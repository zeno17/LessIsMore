Ronald Koeman has made goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg his first signing as manager of Everton.The Dutchman, 33, moves to Goodison Park on three-year contract after an undisclosed fee was agreed with Fulham.The transfer sees Stekelenburg reunited with Koeman for a third time in his playing career.“I’m very happy - things have moved very fast over the last couple days,” Stekelenburg told evertontv.“He [Koeman] has come to Everton and he called me a few days after asking if I was willing to follow him. It wasn’t difficult to make that choice.“He’s one of the best coaches - he’s straight talking, he’s fair and he has confidence in me which counts as well.“I’ve been here [in England] for a couple of seasons and I love the Premier League. It’s fantastic that I can stay.”Manager Koeman added: “Obviously I know Maarten well having worked with him at two clubs before.“I know through his professionalism, hardworking approach and personality he will fit in well with what I will be building at Everton.”Stekelenburg first worked under the new Everton boss at Ajax, winning the Eredivisie title in 2004 as a 21-year-old.Capped 54 times with the Netherlands, the stopper appeared in the 2010 World Cup final against Spain.He spent almost a decade at Ajax, in which time he won another Dutch top-flight title in 2011, as well as collecting three KNVB Cup winner’s medals.A switch to Roma followed in 2011 and after two years in the Italian capital, he then moved to the Premier League with Fulham.Stekelenburg spent the 2014/15 campaign on loan at Monaco and last season linked up with Koeman again at Southampton, on a season-long deal.He played in a total of 25 games in his year with the Saints, prior to signing in at Goodison Park.

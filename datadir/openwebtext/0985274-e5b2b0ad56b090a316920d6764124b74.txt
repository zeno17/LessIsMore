Eskom to cut power in 2 municipalities

Johannesburg - Eskom has issued notices to cut the power supply to two municipalities in the Free State with a debt of R400m, it said on Friday.

The two municipalities, Maluti-a-Phofung and Ngwathe local municipality, would not have power in December if the matter was not resolved.

In a notice, Eskom said it would disconnect the bulk electricity supply to the Maluti-a-Phofung on 4 December if it failed to pay an outstanding amount of R205 679 819. The Ngwathe local municipality had until 6 December to pay R188 556 326.

Eskom said that as the sole provider of electricity to municipalities, it was obliged to supply such services on a financially sustainable basis.

The municipalities' failure to timeously pay had jeopardised the financial sustainability of the supply.

Eskom invited all parties to submit written comments about the planned disconnection.

Democratic Alliance Free State MPL Peter Frewen said it was unacceptable that municipalities took payment on behalf of Eskom, with the authority to cut residents' electricity supply in the event of non-payment, but themselves failed to pay Eskom.

"In the end, the people bear the brunt of poor management by the ANC government. Our councillors will engage with the municipal mangers in order to negotiate, without delay, repayment options with Eskom," he said.

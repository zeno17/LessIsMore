Two people have been arrested by the police for allegedly stabbing to death a 21-year-old caretaker of a public toilet after he objected to their taking drugs inside the toilet.

The incident comes barely a week after an e-rickshaw driver was allegedly beaten to death after he stopped two youths from urinating in public in northwest Delhi.

Twenty one-year-old Rahul and his mother Shyamalata were caretakers of two public toilets in Delhi's Nangloi area.

According to Shyamalata's statement to police, she saw three youngsters taking drugs inside a public toilet. She asked them not to do so following which they left the spot but not before threatening her with dire consequences.

A few minutes later, the three youngsters returned to the spot and attacked Shyamlata. When Rahul tried to save his mother, the trio stabbed him repeatedly.

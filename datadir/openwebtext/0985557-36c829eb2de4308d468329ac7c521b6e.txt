Viggo Mortensen, Oscar Isaac and Kirsten Dunst go on holiday...

Hossein Amini has built a very respectable career as a screenwriter, responsible for Drive and The Wings Of The Dove and called in by studios for big would-be tentpoles like Snow White And The Huntsman and 47 Ronin. Now he's turning to directing as well, and upcoming thriller The Two Faces Of January is his debut. Here's the trailer and poster for the film, which stars the interesting combo of Viggo Mortensen, Oscar Isaac and Kirsten Dunst.

brightcove.createExperiences();As you probably picked up from that trailer, Mortensen is a con artist and Dunst plays his wife. They're on the run abroad when they meet local guide Rydal (Isaac) and the three work together to flee the country after the murder of a police officer. Judging by the significant glances being exchanged between Dunst and Isaac's characters here, that isn't all they'll be working on either.

The Two Faces Of January is screening at the Berlin Film Festival before opening in the UK on May 16. Better get your linen suits and straw hats ready by then.

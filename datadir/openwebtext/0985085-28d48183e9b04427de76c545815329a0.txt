CHICAGO (March 22, 2014) - The Chicago Fire Soccer Club announced Saturday that the club has acquired midfielder Grant Ward on loan from Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Per league and team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.

"Grant is a young, technically-gifted player," said Fire Head Coach and Director of Soccer Frank Yallop. "I watched him play in England, and throughout our preseason training camp, Grant consistently proved that he has what it takes to do well in MLS. We look forward to him joining our squad once he has recovered from his injury."

Born in Lewisham, England, Ward joined the Tottenham Academy in July 2011, where he made a combined 26 appearances and scored three times from 2011-12.

Ward made 20 total appearances for the Spurs U18s during the 2012-13 season, including three FA Youth Cup matches.

The 19-year-old joined the Fire for preseason training camp in 2014 and scored two goals in preseason play, one on Feb. 8 in a 2-0 win over D.C. United in Bradenton, Fla., (WATCH) and another in a 2-1 win over the Colorado Rapids in Tucson, Ariz. (WATCH).

Ward underwent surgery on March 11 to repair a fractured fifth metatarsal. Ward will remain in England to rehabilitate his foot before joining the Fire.

"Grant's injury is an unfortunate one but we fully expect him to bounce back," said Fire Technical Director Brian Bliss. "We saw the type of player Grant is while he was with us during preseason, and we're here to support and do what we can to help him get back to full fitness so he can join us later this season."

Gamers who are frustrated switching between a mouse and keyboard during gameplay might be interested in this new games controller called the Kings Assembly, which has been designed to provide players with both a full mechanical keyboard, high-precision laser mouse and analog joysticks to enjoy in a unique form factor design.

Solid Art Labs the creators behind the new Kings Assembly controller studied how the human hand works to create the unique Kings Assembly controller. That has been specifically designed to provide the best ergonomics a controller can for gaming. Watch the video after the jump to learn more about the Kings Assembly project and see it in action.

The Kings Assembly controller offers users 30 keys for control by each hand with finger key rows angled for fast access, 5 keys for each thumb and a 2-axis analog joystick for each thumb. Solid Art Labs explain a little more about their new controller:

“We challenged ourselves to find a way to move a mouse quickly and accurately without using fingers or thumbs. We designed a contoured palm rest that comfortably anchors your palm and enables you to drive the mouse without moving a single digit. The palm rest is designed to allow unobstructed movement of your fingers and thumb while still providing enough leverage in all directions to maintain precise mouse control.

With fingers and thumbs liberated we put controls within easy reach so you can type, use hotkeys, hold buttons down and manipulate joysticks while accurately controlling the mouse.”

The Kings Assembly project is currently over on the Kickstarter crowd funding website looking to raise enough pledges to make the jump from concept to production.

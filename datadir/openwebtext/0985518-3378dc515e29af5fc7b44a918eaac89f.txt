James Harrison apparently is spending his suspension at home, watching games and critiquing every hit he believes is a personal foul.

The Steelers linebacker did it Saturday night when he took to Twitter in protest after no flag was thrown on Cowboys safety Abram Elam for throwing his shoulder into Buccaneers wide receiver Michael Spurlock's chest. And Harrison did it again Sunday during the Patriots-Broncos game after Elvis Dumervil's jarring sack of Tom Brady during the fourth quarter.

"Kill it!" Harrison tweeted. "That's a part of the helmet in the chest, the same thing I got fined for against buffalo last year!"

Harrison is right. He was flagged and docked $25,000 by the NFL last season for helmet contact to the chest of Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. That hit actually capped off a year in which Harrison was fined four times for a total of $125,000.

Harrison currently is serving a one-game suspension for his hit last week on Browns quarterback Colt McCoy that will cause the linebacker to miss Monday night's showdown with the 49ers, so his evident frustration is understandable.

Truth be told, a second look at Dumervil's hit on Brady reveals that Harrison might have a point, based on the rules. But you be the judge.

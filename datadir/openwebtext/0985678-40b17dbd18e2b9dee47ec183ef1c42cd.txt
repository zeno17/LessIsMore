It comes as no real surprise, but today Milestone have confirmed that MXGP3 will soon be making its way to a console or PC near you.

Arriving in the Spring of 2017, on Xbox One, PS4 and PC, MXGP3 – The Official Motocross Videogame is based on the 2016 season, giving players the most dynamic, enjoyable motocross experience yet. With innovative visuals and new techniques being allowed by Unreal Engine 4, they’ll be taking MXGP3 to the next level.

Dynamic, rather unpredictable weather conditions will be in place, with the change from sun to heavy rain influencing every rider’s visibility. The highly-deformable ground, mud and dust will however be the greatest challenge – mastering that could well be key to your motocross success.

There will also be an in depth career mode, enhanced customisation, all the official MXGP and MX2 2016 riders, official tracks including MXoN and both offline and online modes available.

MXGP3 promises to be more than real! Check out the announcement trailer below.

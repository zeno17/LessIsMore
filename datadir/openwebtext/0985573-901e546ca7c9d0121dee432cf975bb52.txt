NEWS RELEASE

SEARCHMONT SKI RESORT

*************************

Following a six-year hiatus, the quad lift at Searchmont Ski Resort is set to operate this season. New parts have been ordered, and hill brushing is taking place below the lift lines. As well, resort staff is currently working with provincial regulators on permit and inspection requirements.

“This is great news for all skiers and snowboarders,” said Colin Wilson, General Manager of Searchmont Ski Resort. “The quad lift is a critical piece of infrastructure that significantly expands the scope of the hill. We’re very excited for this opportunity and look forward to the upcoming ski season.”

The updates to the quad lift are being made possible with committed investments from senior levels of government.

To offset the operating costs, Searchmont Ski Association, the non-profit organization that runs the resort, will be leading a fundraising campaign. The kickoff is expected to begin later this month.

Meanwhile, during the off-season, a number of other improvements have been taking place at Searchmont Ski Resort. New shingles are going on all 12 villas.

As well, snow-making capital upgrades and hill remediation are taking place, which means less snow will be required for the resort to open this winter. These renovations are also being made possible with committed investments from senior levels of government.

The Sault Ste. Marie Economic Development Corporation (SSMEDC) purchased Searchmont Ski Resort in December 2014. The acquisition was required to ensure the tourist attraction and quality-of-life generator continued to operate.

As the owner of the resort, the SSMEDC is able to take advantage of significant amounts of capital improvement funding from FedNor and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation, which has provided support for these recent upgrades. Searchmont Ski Association and a special SSMEDC Board Committee have been working together to plan and execute necessary capital improvements to enhance the skiing experience and sustainability of the facility.

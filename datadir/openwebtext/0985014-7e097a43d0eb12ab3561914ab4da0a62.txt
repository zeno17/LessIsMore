One of the most pressing and valuable questions prospective Houston home buyers have following Hurricane Harvey is, "Did this property flood?"

This question has been tackled by Keller Williams Memorial's Paige Martin who has compiled a database of more than 100 neighborhoods and 115 condominiums in Houston that made it through the storm relatively unscathed.

Martin predicts that over the next few months Houston will see a spike in rentals, particularly short terms leases. Interest in homes that did not flood is also going to rise. Martin also claims it will be a good time to be a buyer because there will be fewer people in the market able to look for a new home, Martin wrote on HoustonProperties.com.

"Some buyers were impacted by the flooding, are not able to carry two mortgages, and they will need to fix their home before they can sell it," Martin wrote.

While no part of Houston was spared from Harvey's torrential downpour, Martin identified 13 communities that either had no known flooding problems during Harvey or, at most, had some water in the street.

We like to sleep all day and party all night! This is how we like to live our lives! I’ve got a feeling that everything is gonna be all right, so come on, come on! Let’s party tonight!Kyuappu・RaPaPa! Asu yo ī hi ni nare! Kyuappu・RaPaPa! Wait, wrong song. God my taste in things is all over the fucking place. Anyway, back on TF here. Hmm. I feel like crap at the moment, so I'll hold off another chapter 'till I get The Divine Comedy finished and such. Also, I was thinking of getting that doujinshi done before this but there's just all cum flying around and the art isn't in a stupid style so yeah. I'll get around to that sooner or later, but not now. I'm not in the mood. Other than that, my position still stands. If anyone wants to take over for Terra ForMars, then just let me know. Until next time. See ya!

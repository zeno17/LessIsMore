For the past three years, it was tradition for the Palace Theatre in Albany to ring in the New Year with jam band giants moe. But in June, the band announced they would move their annual celebration to Missoula, Montana, leaving many wondering who might fill the slot at the historic theater in New York’s Capital.

Now, “Should auld acquaintance be forgot” as Twiddle announced they will be the ones to usher fans into 2017 at the Palace Theatre on December 31. Joining them will be special guests Aqueous and Soule Monde for what is sure to be a very special event.

Twiddle has been rising in popularity in the festival scene as well as making appearances at Red Rocks Amphitheater the past two years. This year they sold out the Capital Theater in Port Chester. The quartet’s heartfelt lyrics combined with their funky and fun jam style is drawing in fans across the country.

Buffalo’s Aqueous is similarly rising in stature in the live music scene; a pairing as complimentary as it is exciting. Drum and organ duo Soule Monde is very well respected as its members also play in Trey Anastasio Band.

The nearly 3,000 seat theatre sits in the heart of downtown Albany. Originally used for Vaudeville performances in the 1930s, the theatre maintains its original design. Features include a large brass chandelier in the main lobby, stunning murals on the ceilings and gold décor throughout the building.

All tickets are $39 in advance/ $44 day of show and go on sale Friday, Sept 2, at 10 a.m. at the Palace Theatre Box Office and Ticketmaster.

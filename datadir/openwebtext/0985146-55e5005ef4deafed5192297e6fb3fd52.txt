"Anything that can be used to increase campus safety is a win," said Lamine Secka, SDSU's Chief of Police.

The SDSU-branded application — which will be developed by a company called 911 Cellular — will be provide the following functions:

Text message tips, including the ability to attach images

Escort requests

Emergency procedures "flip chart"

Friendwatch safety timer

GPS tracking of safety shuttles

Crime mapping

Emergency button which includes indoor positioning location

Computer desktop panic buttons

The application is tentatively expected to be available for download later in the semester.

In addition to the mobile application, similar funding will provide new bicycles for the campus police officers and Community Service Officers.

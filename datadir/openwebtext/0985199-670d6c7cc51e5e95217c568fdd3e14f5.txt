The comic was created in Inkscape.



I created following vectors for this comic:

All vectors of Courage the Cowardly Dog

Courage's (or Spike's) desk

Vector of the scroll

Background in the first panel

I edited and used following vectors:

Twilight Sparkle by Sulyo [link] (changed the eyes and tail)

Princess Celestia Reading - Season 2 Poster by Takua770 [link] (once without editing; twice with editing)

Library by QTMarx [link] (I had to draw books myself, though, because his SVG file didn't have them, and I had to extend it upwards

I used the following vectors:

Quill by ZuTheSkunk [link]

Princess Celestia's Room by tamalesyatole [link] (I had to cut the image to the borders of the page, though... object by object )

The comic was re-made and now it's a vector. And it has more backgrounds and more shadows and better lettering. And the quality of the last three panels has been at least doubled! Or even Tripled! I just couldn't stand the fact that one of my more popular comics was made in bad quality. Now it's definitely better.Featuredon EQD: 06/01/13 link: [link] and 21/03/13 link: [link] Something silly that came to me a while ago.Courage is the best Spike. "No!"

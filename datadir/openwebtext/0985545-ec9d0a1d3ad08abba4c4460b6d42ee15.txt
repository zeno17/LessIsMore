Every year in our NHL Draft Black Book we release our early list for the following seasons draft. This year was no different and below is the top 31 ranked prospects that we included in the 2017 NHL Draft Black Book which we released back on June 8th.

It’s a tight gap between two fantastic prospects at the top of the list. Both Rasmus Dahlin and Andrei Svechnikov were outstanding in our viewings of them last season, but we had to choose one and Dahlin just edged out Svechnikov. It will be interesting to watch both players in 2017/18 as they head towards their draft day in June 2018.

Scouting for the 2018 NHL Draft began right after the conclusion of the 2017 draft with the Select 17 Camp in Buffalo. Scouting continues for the 2018 draft with a few other summer events before things get rolling in September.

We will update this ranking that was created back in June with a new pre-season 2018 NHL Draft Top 31 ranking that we will release in September.

President Trump lashed out at the FBI Friday for not plugging the leaks in his administration.

“The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security “leakers” that have permeated our government for a long time. They can’t even find the leakers within the FBI itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW,” he tweeted.

The comments came hours after it was reported the FBI refused a request from White House chief of staff Reince Priebus to knock down claims that the Trump team had been in communication with Russia during the campaign.

A White House official told reporters that Priebus’ contact with FBI assistant director Andrew McCabe was made after an early morning meeting on Feb. 15.

McCabe, the official said, approached Priebus at the White House and said, “I want you to know story in [the New York Times] is bulls—,” referring to a story in that day’s paper indicating the FBI was investigating contact between Russian intelligence and Trump campaign officials.

“What can we do about this?” Priebus supposedly replied.

McCabe told Priebus he’d get back to him and later called the chief of staff. “We’d love to help but we can’t get into the position of making statements on every story,” McCabe is said to have told Priebus.

But McCabe did give permission for the chief of staff himself to cite “senior intelligence officials” to knock down The Times report, which he did soon thereafter on TV.

The contact raises concerns about the White House possibly meddling in an ongoing law enforcement investigation.

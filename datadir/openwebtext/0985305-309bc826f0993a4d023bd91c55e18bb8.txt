Football Federation Australia (FFA) has issued a show cause notice to Melbourne Victory following incidents involving some of its fans before and during Saturday night’s Hyundai A-League match at AAMI Park.

FFA has given the club until 5pm (AEDT) Wednesday afternoon to show cause why they should not face sanction for bringing the game into disrepute through the conduct of its supporters, under the FFA Code of Conduct.

FFA has issued the show cause notice after receiving all relevant incident and match reports from Victoria Police, AAMI Park management and FFA’s security advisers, outlining incidents that took place before and during the match.

FFA CEO David Gallop today reiterated his disbelief and disappointment at the actions of some Melbourne Victory fans at a time when it spectator misconduct is in the spotlight.

"FFA has today issued Melbourne Victory with a Show Cause Notice after receiving detailed information from Victoria Police and others that identifies some Melbourne Victory supporters as taking part in actions that have cast a shadow on football,” said FFA CEO David Gallop.

“The timing of these incidents has shocked many people given the acute focus on these issues. No one could have missed the fact that FFA, our clubs, players and coaches have been explicitly clear in our condemnation of actions over the last week around the ignition of flares. We must continue to hold the safety and enjoyment of true football fans at the heart of our decisions.

“The reaction of a section of Melbourne Victory fans, players and coaches on Saturday night has again sent a clear message that this minority is not welcome.”

FFA will also continue to work with police and stadium security to identify individuals and ensure they are subject to the banning procedures, which will be announced later today.

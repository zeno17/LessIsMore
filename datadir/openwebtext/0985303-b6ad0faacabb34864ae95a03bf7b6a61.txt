You might want to wake up before September ends because Green Day is playing in Toronto this month. And best of all, you can grab tickets to see Billie Joe Armstrong and the gang for just $25.

Green Day's headlining a special celebration for Canadian Olympians at the World Cup of Hockey Fan Village in the Distillery District on September 23. Why the organizers chose a distinctly American band for this event is still unclear, but I guess hockey players love Green Day?

The $25 standing-room only tickets go on sale on Ticketmaster at 10 a.m. on Thursday, September 8.

The World Cup of Hockey Distillery District takeover is split into two sections from September 16 to 25 - the Distillery Fan Village and the East Fan Village.

The former is free to enter from September 17 to 25 and the latter is free from September 17 to 22 and later, on the 24 and 23. You'll need a ticket to enter the East Fan Village on the 23rd to see Green Day as well as on the 16th for another unannounced premium concert.

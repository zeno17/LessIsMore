This alpha release comes out to show the potential of the engine, but it still lacks many features commonly found in other engines, and especially the effects are postponed until the major features are implemented.

Almost all the areas are work in progress.

Driver issues:

Outerra engine requires recent graphics drivers with OpenGL 3.3+ support. It will warn you if your drivers are outdated, or even refuse to run in case you've got old drivers that are known not to work at all.Please note that the requirements will likely change with evolving versions of the software and there's no guarantee that the previous minimum hardware and OS version will continue to work with the updates.Minimum requirements:Recommended:Download links for the Outerra tech demo, upgradable in-game to the Anteworld sandbox game (alpha):Please check the Graphics driver issues topic to resolve the most common issues with the drivers.This alpha release features:The demo comes with the whole planet Earth that can be explored in a free-camera (UFO) mode or in a testing vehicle (8-wheeler truck). There's also a first person walking mode.After upgrading to the full version (alpha, access to all further versions), the following additional features become available:People who like it and/or want to support us and the development of Outerra engine can buy the alpha release of Anteworld sandbox game at a discounted price, by upgrading from within the demo. Doing so will give you access to regularly released alpha/beta updates of the game, together with the final version when it's done. The price will gradually rise with each major release.You will also become our beta-testers, with ability to influence the priorities of the development.The full version includes more vehicles, allows you to use vehicle mods made by users, a basic sandbox tool set allowing you to create roads and runways and place stock or imported objects. A model importer and vehicle configurator enables you to create custom models and vehicles and share it with others. It also enables you to play with dynamic terrain deformation (craters) and more things being regularly released. Changelog for the active version can be found in the latest version forum topic.Data for the default location are already included within the installer, the rest of it will be downloaded automatically on demand as you explore the world.The alpha state of the engine also means that it's not very optimized yet. It consumes more GPU memory than it should, and spends some time rendering things that is not eventually visible etc.Windows XP (32bit): Because of a lower and fixed limit on available system memory for GPU transfers on 32-bit Windows XP you may encounter a not-enough memory problem. In this case please close all other apps, especially browsers and other apps that consume a lot of NP (non-paged) memory as shown in the Task Manager.Please check the Graphics driver issues topic to resolve the most common issues with the drivers.

Tim Brown is going to the World Cup.

The All Whites vice-captain has completed a remarkable recovery from shoulder surgery and is preparing to join his All Whites team-mates in South Africa ahead of the opening match against Slovakia in Rustenburg on Tuesday.

Brown's return to New Zealand's 23-man squad came after discussions between Auckland surgeon Stu Walsh and team doctor Celeste Geertsema.



"We're thankful for the surgeon and the medical staff that looked after him for doing a tremendous job," coach Ricki Herbert said.



"He has apparently come through everything so well."

A team spokesman said Brown had made "a remarkable recovery" in the fortnight since the operation.



He said Wellington midfielder Cole Peverley, who was called up as replacement cover for Brown, would stay on in South Africa.

Meanwhile, All Whites captain Ryan Nelsen will sit out the team's World Cup warm-up match against Chile today in South Africa with an ear infection.

However, a New Zealand Football Association spokesman said the influential defender was not in any doubt of missing the team's World Cup opener against Slovakia next week.

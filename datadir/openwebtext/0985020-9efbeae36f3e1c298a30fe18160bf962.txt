A Feilding man has been banned from going near a high school's farms after allegedly committing an indecent act with a calf.

William Louis Temaari appeared before a registrar in the Palmerston North District Court today charged with the offence.

It is alleged the incident with the calf took place on Wednesday last week.

The 31-year-old entered no plea and was remanded on bail until next month.

As part of his bail, he must not consume alcohol or drugs and cannot go within 500 metres of Feilding High School's farms.

The high school has two farms - one adjacent to the school and another just outside of the Manawatu town.

According to the school's website, the farms are used by students at the school who are studying agriculture.

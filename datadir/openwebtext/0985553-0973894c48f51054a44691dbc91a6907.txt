Just thought I’d throw this story out there for anyone that doesn’t want to hold on to their last meal.

Washed-up pop star Madonna, 59, made an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” Monday night to promote her latest failing album (it's called the “Rebel Heart Tour,” and it sold just 3,848 copies in its first week).

Anyway, the First Lady of the Night was talking to Fallon about the time he introduced her to former president Barack Obama, and Madonna’s response was barfbag-worthy.

“Oh God, that was one of the most unforgettable moments of my life,” Madonna said right before uttering a sentence that would make you puke in your soup: “I’m still having erotic dreams about it. I am. I’m sorry.”

Madonna, on national television, on “The Tonight Show,” said that she has erotic dreams about Obama. Think about that for a minute.

Or don’t. No. It’s probably better that you don’t.

In disbelief, Fallon responded, “No. You weren’t hav...No, that’s not the truth.”

“No. It is the truth,” Madonna said doubling down.

Now that this image that could only be dreamed up in a horror movie is in everyone’s head, I’ll be on my way.

I’m sorry. I’m a bad person for this. Happy Tuesday!

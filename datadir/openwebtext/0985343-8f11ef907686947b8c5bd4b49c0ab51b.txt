About

I am an artist, designer and musician from Cleveland, Ohio. In 2010, I received my BFA from the Cleveland Institute of Art, with an emphasis in Game Design in the T.I.M.E. – Digital Arts major.

As a child, I would often draw on any surface I could take with me, memorize whatever Led Zeppelin songs my dad had on repeat, and save money only for video games. As an adult, I am still doing most of the above, but I also work around the greater Cleveland area as an illustrator, graphic and web designer.

In addition, I have written, recorded, produced and performed with The Commonwealth since co-founding the band in 2009. I hope to one day meet Mads Mikkelsen, and my favorite ice cream is Jeni’s Roasted Strawberry Buttermilk.

Pro Football Talk reports that the Bills are signing OT Jordan Mills off of the Lions practice squad.

Ian Rapoport confirms that report and adds that Mills is already flying to London for their Week 7 match up.

Mills, 24, is a former fifth round pick of the Bears back in 2013. He spent two years in Chicago before he was released during roster cuts and later claimed off of waivers by the Cowboys.

Dallas elected to waive him after just a week with the team, but he managed to sign on to the Lionsâ€™ practice squad close to a month ago.

In 2014, Mills appeared in 13 games for the Bears and was rated by Pro Football Focus as the No. 66 offensive tackle out of 84 qualifying players.

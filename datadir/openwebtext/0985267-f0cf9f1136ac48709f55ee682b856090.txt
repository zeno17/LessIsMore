WRIC Newsroom - (WRIC) -- Hormel Foods is voluntarily recalling 153 cases, or 1,871 total pounds, of a single code date of SKIPPY® Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter Spread, due to the possibility that some jars may contain small pieces of metal shavings.

The pieces of metal were discovered on an in-line magnet check during routine cleaning.

"Foodborne objects that are greater than 7mm in length may cause injury such as severe choking with airway obstruction, gastrointestinal peroration or secondary infection," the Food and Drug Administration said in a press release on Thursday.

The recalled product is limited to 16.3 ounce jars with a "Best If Used By" date of DEC1416LR1 with a package UPC code of 37600-10500. The code date is located on top of the lid. A photo of the product and "Best If Used By" date appears below. Recalled product was sent to distribution centers for Publix, Target and Walmart located in Georgia, Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware and Arkansas.

No other sizes, varieties or other packaging configurations of SKIPPY® brand peanut butter or peanut spreads are included in this recall.

No reports of injuries or complaints have been received at this time, but the company is issuing the recall to make sure that consumers are aware of the potential hazard.

If you have this in your pantry or fridge, you should return it to the store where purchased for an exchange or call Hormel Foods Customer Relations at 1-866-475-4779, Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Central Time.

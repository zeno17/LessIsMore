From OpenZFS

Welcome to OpenZFS

OpenZFS brings together developers and users from various open-source forks of the original ZFS on different platforms and we're always looking to grow our community. There are a multitude of ways to contribute to the project and contributors are happy to help newcomers. As we add diverse perspectives, our community becomes richer, and we're committed to creating an environment where all people feel welcome. Information for new contributors is available here.

Summary

OpenZFS was announced in September 2013 as the truly open source successor to the ZFS project. Our community brings together developers from the illumos, FreeBSD, Linux, OS X and Windows platforms, and a wide range of companies that build products on top of OpenZFS.

OpenZFS is an outstanding storage platform that encompasses the functionality of traditional filesystems, volume managers, and more, with consistent reliability, functionality and performance across all distributions:

Automated Testing

Pull requests submitted to our GitHub page are automatically tested, by running ztest and the ZFS Test Suite. We use illumos VM's running on AWS to perform the tests, and results are available publicly.

Thanks to infrastructure sponsor Nexenta for covering our AWS hosting costs!

Goals

The high-level goals of OpenZFS are:

to raise awareness of the quality, utility, and availability of open source implementations of ZFS

of the quality, utility, and availability of open source implementations of ZFS to encourage open communication about ongoing efforts to improve open source ZFS

about ongoing efforts to improve open source ZFS to ensure consistent reliability, functionality, and performance of all distributions of ZFS.

The main technical goal of OpenZFS is easier sharing of code between platforms. Strategies include:

creating a platform-independent mailing list for developers to review ZFS code and architecture changes from all platforms

smoothing the illumos integration process

making it easy to run both ztest and the ZFS test suite (TestRunner or STF based) on each platform

reducing code differences between the platforms.

MTG 100: Vegan Fighter Victor Saravia Shares His Inspiring Story

Muay Thai Guy Podcast – Episode 100

Victor Saravia has quite the story to tell.

At a young age Victor was involved with gangs in Los Angeles and could’ve easily gone down the wrong path. Fortunately, after getting in trouble with the law and almost being sent off to juvy, he was able to change the direction of his life and become one of the most talked about prospects in Muay Thai today.

I had the chance to chat with this beast of a fighter and learn more about how he’s been able to overcome adversity and avoid bad influences thanks to his family, friends and teammates at Muay Thai America gym in California. We chat about his career, training methods and much more including:

How he grew up in a bad neighborhood and used to fight his friends for money.

Why he decided to get out of the bad situations he was in and change his life for the better.

How football played a huge role in teaching him respect, discipline and work ethic

What a typical day of training is like for him.

Why he decided to turn pro after 15 amateur fights.

Why he eats a vegan diet and how it’s affected both his mental clarity and physical fitness.

His goals for his career and why he wants to be one of the best ever.

Thoughts on his last fight against Daniel McGowan where he lost via cut.

How he needed some time off after that fight to reset, reflect and refocus on his goals.

And much, MUCH more.

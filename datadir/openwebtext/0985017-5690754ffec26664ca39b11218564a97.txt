I am running xubuntu 13.10 on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. It works very well, except the behaviour of my clickpad (touchpad where the buttons are built into the surface) makes it essentially unusable.

The default behaviour means that the whole area of the clickpad moves the mouse cursor, so that when I try and click anything, the mouse will move around slightly and I will miss my target.

After googling around, I saw suggestions suggesting that I should modify my /etc/X11/xorg.d/50-synaptics file (man) so that the AreaBottomEdge option is set to the height of the button area on my clickpad.

This worked in that it prevented the mouse from moving when I touch the clickable area, but it now does not allow me to move the mouse with another finger while holding the left click button down, so I cannot do selections/dragging/etc.

What I am after is configuration settings (or a different driver) that will turn off mouse movement over the clickable area of the clickpad, but still allow me to move the mouse while another finger is resting on, or clicking down on the clickable area. Essentially I want to make the clickable areas act like real buttons.

Thank you.

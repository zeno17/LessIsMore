Greetings Rocksmith fans, and happy new year!

@DanAmrich posted a clue yesterday evening and after 27 pages, we have our answer!

Each line decrypted into a different phrase which led to a number

1- THIRD HEEGNER NUMBER

2- SUM OF ONE OF EACH OF UNITED STATES COINS LESS THAN A DOLLAR

3- FIRST SQUARE WHERE THE DIGITS ARE SQUARES

4- THE FIRST THREE POSITIVE INTEGERS CUBED THEN ADDED

5- CHARGEN PORT

6- FIRST INTEGER RECIPROCAL WITH INFINITELY REPEATING SEXAGESIMAL REPRESENTATION

1 — 3

2 — 91

3 — 49

4 — 36

5 — 19

6 — 7

As well hidden on the picture was “001-118” which referred to the atomic numbers in the Periodic Table of Elements.

li – 3

pa – 91

in – 49

k – 19

n – 7

rk – 36

Yup, it’s my favourite band, Linkin Park!

No stranger to music games, Linkin Park was an on disc song on Guitar Hero World Tour with What I’ve Done, later reappearing in Warriors of Rock with Bleed It Out and even received a DLC 6 Pack of songs from their 2010 album, A Thousand Suns. Rock Band features One Step Closer on Rock Band 2 and ten songs offered through two DLC packs! Heck, they even appeared on DJ Hero 2 DLC!

While not the most guitar/bass driven band, the people have spoken and with this release @UbisoftStudioSF continues their Top 40 Requested Artist streak!

Here are the top 10 Linkin Park songs from @Spotify, what song do you think is most likely to appear next week? Not on the list? Add your own in the poll below!

Are you excited for Linkin Park? Or will this be the first “skip” of 2015. Let us know!

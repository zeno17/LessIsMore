The science marathon continues with one of the biggest scientific series on the internet.

Don’t worry, this won’t take long.

@MinutePhysics, created by Henry Reich, came from humble beginnings, such as explaining simple concepts like dark matter and gravity. He’s since educated the world in bite-size pieces on virtually every popular science concept under the sun (or in proximity to it). Want the TL;DR for landing on Mars sometime soon? Or perhaps you want to know once and for all: is there a cat or not?

And you can always share your favorites using spee.ch.

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — One reason the Vikings drafted Trae Waynes in the first round is that they think he’s a smart football player, but he also needs to be a versatile one. Though it’s been a baptism by fire, so far Waynes hasn’t been burned.

“It’s been fun. You know, it’s been a learning experience,” he said from training camp in Mankato. “Just taking it one day at a time and just trying to do my best to pick up on everything that I’m being coached.”

The learning curve is steep for any NFL rookie. Even a first-round draft pick for cornerback is not exempt from the pressure, especially given all of the other things that the Vikings are asking Waynes to do.

The nickel position may get him on the field, so long as he masters it.

“The biggest learning curve for me is learning nickel and all the things that come with it,” he said. “I’ve never played it before. This is my first time playing it, but it’s almost like playing linebacker.”

Even for Waynes, the Vikings coaching staff doesn’t expect the position to come quickly.

“There are a lot of things happening,” head coach Mike Zimmer said. “You’ve got to play the run, you’ve got to play combination routes, you’ve got pass offs. There’s a lot more involved being in there. Like I said, I think it’s going to be good for his overall development.”

Ultimately, the reason he’s here and what he is most looking forward to are the mano-a-mano, “may the best man win” moments.

“That’s what you live for,” he said.

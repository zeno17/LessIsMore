Yeah, I'm getting back to the crossover stuff, and man, I gotta be honest, I've only played Earthbound like for 2 weeks and I already LOVE it!! (It's a pretty amazing game, if you really like RPG's then you should really give it a try someday, it has a pretty amazing and really interesting story) so yeah, when I got to Saturn's Valley I really was like: "This place feels really funny and derpy" and then I thought "Derpy......" then well, I had this idea, anyway, I really hope you like it ;3 (and also because both of them are kinda funny and cute ;3; )Featured as theof Nightly Discussion #895!!!Thank you so much guys, it's such a great honor ;3;Featured in EQD Drawfriend Stuff #2077 in the 3rd place!Thank you so much guys! ;3;

Fall in love with the poetry of the land! Residents of Nova Scotia are invited to submit original poems, verses, or rhymes about farming or food for the sixth annual issue of Open Heart Farming.

Guidelines: We ask that poems not exceed 28 lines long (not including title and your byline) and 43 letters wide. This is due to the formatting of the issue and allows us to publish approximately 20 poems. We can sometimes include slightly larger poems and love little ones like haiku.

Please include one or two paragraphs about yourself, your relationship to farming and/or food, what inspired your poem, and where you live in Nova Scotia. Submit up to three poems to openheartfarming@

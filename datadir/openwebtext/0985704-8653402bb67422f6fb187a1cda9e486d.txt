I agree, but you can also look at MWO as being a complicated game where "information is ammunition". A simple wall hack is MUCH more impacting than most other games that typically have respawns (except CS). The aimbot would be a challenge to program to deal with all the fine details of MWO, velocity, hitboxes, movement speeds, I can see someone thinking the challenge would be fun. However we'd only be talking about a very VERY small minority of cheaters (who are already an extremely small minority).



Yeah, I personally don't get what the appeal is other than understanding the appeal of a coding/tuning challenge.



I think the reason people develop cheating tools is money. The simplest explanation comes from game theory. Individuals are often motivated to do things that benefit them but which harm the community over all. A good example is nuclear armament. In the world right now, it makes sense for any given country to stockpile some nuclear weapons, because that increases that country's security and gives that country political bargaining chips. However the world as a whole, and all of mankind, becomes less secure with the more nuclear weapons there are lying around.We therefore try to implement rules (or international laws and treaties in the above example) to prevent people from doing things that benefit themselves at the expense of everyone, overall. What this means is that any given individual stands to come out ahead if they could just break the rules and get away with it. There is therefore a demand for tools that make it easy to break the rules and get away with it.In other words, where ever there is a rule forbidding any action that would benefit only the person who takes that action, there is necessarily a demand for the ability to break that rule.

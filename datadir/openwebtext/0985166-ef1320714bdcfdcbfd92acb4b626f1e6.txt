Neo-creationism

http://www.enotes.com/topic/Neo-creationism

Misconception: “Gaps in the fossil record disprove evolution.”

Response: The fact that some transitional fossils are not preserved does not disprove evolution. Evolutionary biologists do not expect that all transitional forms will be found and realize that many species leave no fossils at all. Lots of organisms don’t fossilize well and the environmental conditions for forming good fossils are not that common. So, science actually predicts that for many evolutionary changes there will be gaps in the record.

Also, scientists have found many transitional fossils. For example, there are fossils of transitional organisms between modern birds and their theropod dinosaur ancestors, and between whales and their terrestrial mammal ancestors.

Aronra The Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism

Complete Series (1-15)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmQZ4f9f_Yw

This an excellent series of educational videos by Youtube user Aronra.

http://www.youtube.com/user/AronRa

In addition to providing a great deal of interesting information on evolution, these videos explore the various arguments used by creationists and the fallacies they contain.

1. Exploring the idea that accepting evolution is tantamount to declaring atheism, or that one need be creationist to be Christian.

2. Exploring the erroneous notion that the holy scriptures were written by God, rather than be subject to the errs of humanity 9:56

3. Exploring the notion of absolute truth and how revealing that would actually more of a fallacy than regular truth. 19:55

4. My attempt to explain empirical inquiry as a rational alternative to the false propaganda propagated on faith. 29:54

5. Disputing the canard that evolution is a religion, and therefore somehow equal to creationism. 39:53

6. Taking on common Creationist canards relating to what evolution is and isn’t, and what it does or doesn’t depend on or relate to. 49:52

7. This one deals with the notion that everything must have an intelligently-designed purpose, or it must be random accidents. 59:51

8. This one deals with mutations and “information”. 1:09:50

9. Listing just a handful of the myriad transitional species we’ve found, and that creationists insist do not exist or somehow still don’t count. 1:19.49

10. An abbreviated introductory primer to cladistic phylogenetics, the most compelling and overwhelming evidence of evolution and our place in nature. 1:30.18

11. An abbreviated introductory primer to classicist phylogenetic, the most compelling and overwhelming evidence of evolution and our place in nature. 1:40.33

12. An abbreviated introductory primer to classicist phylogenetic, the most compelling and overwhelming evidence of evolution and our place in nature. 1:50.47

13. Every “evolutionist hoax” ever alleged was either fabricated or misrepresented to such a degree that each contributes to a growing list of creationist frauds. 2:01.21

14(a). The 1st of two-part tirade about creationists’ claims of having evidence, when all they really have are baseless assertions and assumed conclusions supported only by frauds and fallacies. 2:12.20

14(b). The 2nd half of a two-part tirade about creationists’ claims of having evidence, when all they really have are baseless assertions and assumed conclusions supported only by frauds and fallacies. 2:22.20

15 (a) The first of a two-part final installment to this series, explaining what the words, hypothesis, fact, law, and Theory actually are, rather than what creationists want us to think they are. Hint: a scientific theory isn’t a guess, but an explanative study of real phenomenon. 2:32.41

15(b) The second of a two-part explanation of how a scientific theory differs from the uncertain speculation which creationists would like to believe it is. Although this is the final installment to this series, the playlist will also include a sort of epilogue episode which isn’t a necessarily ‘foundational falsehood’ but is still relevant to the topic. 2:43.37

~The Talk.Origins Archive

A collection of articles and essays that explore the creationism/evolution controversy from a mainstream scientific perspective. In other words, the authors of most of the articles in this archive accept the prevailing scientific view that the earth is ancient, that there was no global flood, and that evolution is responsible for the earth’s present biodiversity.

~Martin Hanczyc: The line between life and not-life.

In his lab, Martin Hanczyc makes “protocells,” experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells. His work demonstrates how life might have first occurred on Earth … and perhaps elsewhere too.

Martin Hanczyc explores the path between living and nonliving systems, using chemical droplets to study behavior of the earliest cells.

~What are your thoughts on the Young Earth Creationists, claiming that the Earth and entire universe is only 6,500 years old? There were multiple booming civilizations prior to that time, discovered cave writings, dino bones, and a mountain of proven scientific facts to the contrary!

Inventing completely fraudulent evidence and spreading it so aggressively, goes beyond belief. It is an outright lie. They know it is…but their average sheeple don’t.

~The Stars Died For Us

“Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.”

Lawrence Krauss (AAI 2009 “A Universe From Nothing”)

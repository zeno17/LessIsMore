Robyn Benson, the Victoria woman who was declared brain-dead in December, underwent surgery on Saturday to deliver a healthy baby boy before she died the next day.

Benson was five months pregnant when she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on Dec. 28 that left her brain-dead. She was put on life-support at a B.C. hospital until doctors determined the fetus was viable enough for them to perform a caesarean section.

On Monday, Benson's husband Dylan announced his son's arrival — and Benson's passing — on Facebook.

"My beautiful and amazing son, Iver Cohen Benson, was born. Iver is healthy and is the cutest and most precious person I have ever met," wrote Dylan Benson.

"On Sunday, we had to unfortunately say goodbye to the strongest and most wonderful woman I have ever met. I miss Robyn more than words can explain. I could not be more impressed with her strength, and I am so lucky to have known her. She will live on forever within Iver, and in my heart."

Dylan Benson said Iver will remain under the care of hospital staff until he is healthy enough to go home.

'Baby Iver' fund exceeds $144K

Dylan Benson, a 32-year-old who works for an IT company, started the "Baby Iver" fund on the crowd-funding website YouCaring.com shortly after his wife's hospitalization.

He said he had to take leave from work to deal with the demands of single-parenthood and the stress of planning a funeral, and he needed money to cover some of the costs associated with missing work and having a new baby.

Dylan Benson's initial goal was to raise $36,000. Within days of his story making front-page news, however, people from around the world started donating. On Feb.10, the Baby Iver fund had raised over $144,016.

Benson said the additional money would go toward his son's care and education, as well as a new living space.

"Thank you to each and every one of you for your love, your kind words, and your support during this incredibly difficult time," said Dylan Benson.

Not in the console form everyone was hoping for, but at least the series is getting new portable installments. Features and screens after the jump.

Available this fall for the DS and PSP, Battlefront: Elite Squadron features ground and space battles and loads of multiplayer options. The PSP version will allow for detailed customization of your player model and equipment within 16-player matches while the DS version uses class-based 4-player matches. Taking a page from Pandemic’s earlier Battlefront and LOTR: Conquest titles, Elite Squadron will let you step into the shoes of Star Wars heroes and villains like Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and Darth Maul.

Elite Squadron‘s UK developer Rebellion worked on the PSP’s Battlefront: Renegade as well as The Simpsons Game and Alien Vs. Predator.

The fate of Free Radical’s Battlefront is still uncertain, but this news gives hope that Crytek will find some room within their budget for what would surely be a successful game.

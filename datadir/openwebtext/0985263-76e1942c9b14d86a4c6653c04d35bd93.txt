Sony President Shuhei Yoshida has just confirmed that Playstation 4 gamers won't be able to stream game on to PS VITA while Netflix is running.

In addition to this, Shuhei Yoshida also confirmed that there won't be any need to install disc games onto the HDD in order to play them.

There was some confusion among few Playstation fans related to this, but Shuhei clarified everything. You can check out the Twitter conversation below.

Update:

It seems like Shuhei Yoshida has mistakenly stated that PS4 games can't be installed via disc (as seen in the above conversation). This seems to be a mistake, since Mark Cerny has several times talked about installing a game WHILE you play.

Was Shuhei trying to say that "If you buy the disc version, the game installs to HDD but you still need the disc to boot the game."?.

We have asked for more clarification and will update this post as soon as we get to hear something from Shuhei Yoshida.

Update 2:

An update from our reader named CHRIS (as mention in the comment section below): "Cerny was talking about digital versions of games. While you are

DOWNLOADING the game you are allowed to start playing it as it downloads

and installs the game. Disc based games have no need to be installed to

the HDD as Blu-Ray tech has gotten better and faster.

Northampton Town have signed out-of-contract Leon McSweeney, Bradford City's Alan Connell and Ricky Ravenhill on free transfers and extended Antonio German's loan from Gillingham.

Midfielder Ravenhill, 33, has agreed an 18-month contract.

Defender McSweeney, who was and striker Connell, both 30, have signed until the summer.

Gills forward German, 22, will stay at Sixfields for a further month.

Former Hartlepool and Leyton Orient man McSweeney, who can also play in midfield, signed a short-term deal with Carlisle in September and played 10 times.

Connell has started just once for the Bantams this term, but scored 13 goals for Swindon in the 2011-12 campaign and was on target 25 times for Grimsby the season before.

"He's had success in this league and promotions. He's a goalscorer," boss Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Northampton.

"He's a good guy. He's an honest boy, a decent footballer and he scores goals. At this stage of the season, that's going to be vital."

Ravenhill made eight appearances for the Cobblers at the end of 2013 during a loan spell under previous boss Aidy Boothroyd.

"I know a lot about Ricky," said Wilder. "He's a winner, he's a competitive midfield player.

"A quick assessment of the team is that, in that area, we need not only good footballers but a voice in there."

Meanwhile, goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers has chosen to leave Sixfields following the appointment of Wilder as manager.

Wilder is expected to make more signings before Friday's transfer deadline after Everton striker Hallam Hope returned to his parent club following the expiry of his loan.

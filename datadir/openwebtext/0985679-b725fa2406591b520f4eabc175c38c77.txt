​Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was spotted at a fancy Italian restaurant along with his Reds squad, as the German took his the team out for a bonding session ahead of the season.

New signings Sadio Mane, Georginio Wijnaldum, Loris Karius, Ragnar Klavan and Joel Matip were all in attendance, getting to know their new colleagues off the pitch and training ground.





Christian Benteke was also about, despite rumours linking him with an exit this summer, as was Mamadou Sakho, who was punished by Klopp for turning up late for a flight to the US as well as a team meal.





The manager has warned his team that he will not be rotating too much this season, as the club won't be participating in European competition.

With several players now at the manager's disposal, poor performances could result in minutes being sparsely fed over the season for any one player.





"When we lost the Europa League final, there was absolutely nothing worthwhile about it, just a load of disappointment," Klopp said to Liverpool's official website.





" In the end the only positive thing about not playing European football this year is that we have more time to train and that is what we have to use, 100 per cent.





"That’s why we need to create a very strong team in the best understanding of the word 'team'. We need to have competition.





"We need a situation where the players push themselves and each one pushes the other for each position and wants to be in the team because you have time to recover.





"So it's not that you have to change the team a lot between two Saturday games or two Sunday games - it’s nothing about rotation. It’s about: "OK, who is ready now? Who is ready to perform how we need in each specific game?"'

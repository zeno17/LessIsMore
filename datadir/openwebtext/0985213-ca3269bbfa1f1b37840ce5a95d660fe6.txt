He’s best known as a pianist and composer, but the Arab Spring in 2012 and the ongoing Syrian civil war have focused his musical gifts on activism and humanitarian work.

Now in its third year, the program has expanded its partnerships and the number of pianos. Fifty will be placed in spaces across Atlanta, accessible for the public and available for anyone to play.

Jandali joined “City Lights” host Lois Reitzes to about this year’s festival alongside Emmitt Stevenson, deputy director of Fulton County Arts and Culture.

Pianos for Peace kicks off this Friday and will be available to the public through Sept. 18. The closing ceremony will be held on Sept. 28 at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.

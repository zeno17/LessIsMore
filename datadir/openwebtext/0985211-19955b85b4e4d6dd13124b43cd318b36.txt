softrains-qy:

I purchased 50 digital copies of Yixing’s album on the Xiami APP, in an effort to contribute as a fan so that he can reach 300k sooner (fansign everyone! even if chances of me going is 0.0000001% i still want him to hit the 300k!). It is important that Yixing does well on the Chinese charts, but I know many international fans don’t use the APP or don’t know how to use the Chinese APP, but fear not! It is really quite simple, you can login to Xiami using your weibo account if you have one. If you don’t, you can always drop me an ask and I will try my best to help you get a Xiami account.

1. You must first download the Xiami app here ; just scan the barcode for Apple or Android and you can download it.

2. Open the app to see the home page below and press the top left button.

3. You should be at your page as shown below. Click to log in. Assuming you have a weibo account, choose to log in via weibo and your weibo account will be tied to your xiami account.



4. After logging in, click your library at the homepage. Then, click Purchase.

5. The next page should look like the one below. Click on the top right button:



6. Key in the code (please read below) and click to redeem!

To check if you successfully redeemed, you should be able to play the songs off the album on the APP now~ :D

I currently have 47 44 copies available for you to redeem. You have to key in the code 9T6C955 to redeem a copy.



Any fan of Zhang Yixing is welcomed to redeem a copy! It will work on a first-come-first-serve basis, so redeem away! I hope doing this will help more international fans be able to support and stream Yixing’s music on the Chinese charts :)

Feel free to leave me an ask if you need help to get an account, or encounter any difficulties redeeming a copy, though two of my friends already managed to redeem an album~ I will make a post again when all the albums are redeemed!

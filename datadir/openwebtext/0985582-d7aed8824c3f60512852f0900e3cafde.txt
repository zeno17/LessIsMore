Mr. Trump, who has been pointing to Obamacare’s weaknesses in efforts to marshal support for a health care overhaul, began seizing on the bare counties, frequently noting that Obamacare was set to “implode.” Republicans in Congress also often made note of the bare spots. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that runs the marketplaces, has been periodically updating a map of insurer moves, marking potential bare counties in red.

But then, just as some insurers exited Obamacare markets, others began entering to fill the holes left behind. Centene, a company that has sold Medicaid managed care plans to states, has been a major player in the reversal. It alone has filled more than half of all identified bare counties, part of a big bet on Obamacare. Kevin Counihan, who ran the federal marketplaces in the final years of the Obamacare administration, recently joined the company as an executive. Last week, Centene agreed to fill 14 bare counties in rural Nevada. This week, smaller carriers have stepped up to fill the two last bare counties, in Wisconsin and Ohio.

Behind the scenes, state insurance commissioners have been twisting arms, trying to persuade reluctant insurers to cover the counties without an insurer. But some carriers also recognized advantages in being the sole provider in a given place.

“There are a number of companies that are seeing a business opportunity,” said Katherine Hempstead, a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who studies insurance markets.

Insurer participation for next year is not final, however. That means that insurers could still change their minds and leave. (Others could enter, though that is less likely.) Contracts will not be signed until the end of September.

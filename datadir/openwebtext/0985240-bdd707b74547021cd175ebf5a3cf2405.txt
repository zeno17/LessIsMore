Therefore I've created patch 1.3.3 PTR versions of every 1v1 ladder map (except for Delta Quadrant) and published them to EU.



They are named "Map Name - Patch 1.3.3 PTR - By Dauntless".

Easiest found by searching for "Dauntless", "PTR" or "Patch", since searching for "1.3.3" doesn't work.



Feel free to republish to other regions, but remember to publish the .mod file.



The reason I didn't upload Delta'Quadrant, was because I've used up 9 publish slots on the ladder maps and the last one on the .mod file, so I had to choose one map to not upload. And since DQ is disliked by almost everyone, I chose that one.



Edit: Forgot to mention. The art for the Pylon power radius is the exact same as before. It just looks like the radius isn't changed, but it really is. Dauntless.156 EU || LiquidÂ´HerO | Grubby.Grubby

EMBED >More News Videos Olympic gold medalist and UC Berkeley grad Dana Vollmer talked to ABC7's Kristen Sze about her next challenge -- competing in the Arena Pro Swim Series while pregnant.

A Bay Area Olympic swimmer is going for gold again. And this time, there may be a bump on the road. Or should we say, a bump on the tummy?If you follow swimming, you know Danville resident Dana Vollmer . The 29-year old UC Berkeley grad and three-time Olympian has nothing left to prove after winning nearly three dozen medals in international competitions.Yet, she's out to prove something new next week. At 26 weeks pregnant, Vollmer will compete in the Arena Pro Swim Series in Arizona. We sat down in the studio to talk to her about her latest challenge."Sticking with freestyle, no turns in the 50 free, just one dive, just make it to the other end of the pool and that's it!" said Vollmer.When asked what it's like to train while pregnant, the Olympic gold medalist said, "It's one of those where time is just not a concern anymore. It's one of those where I'm just into it to stay strong, to stay in shape, to prepare for labor."Vollmer says she did not train while carrying her 2-year-old son, so she is eager to see what she can accomplish; under close doctor supervision, of course.In the meantime, her announcement has gotten tons of support on social media with many saying thanks for being such an inspiration.To see the full, inspiring interview with Vollmer, watch the video player below:

Earlier today, the official Rio2016 Twitter account posted a video of the South African winning gold in the London 2012 Games - a tweet that was later deleted according to Mail Online.

Pistorius is currently seeking to appeal his murder conviction for the killing of former girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Pistorius shot Steenkamp through the door of a toilet cubicle in his home early on Valentine's Day 2013. Prosecutors said he killed her after an argument; Pistorius said he killed her by mistake, thinking there was an intruder in the house.

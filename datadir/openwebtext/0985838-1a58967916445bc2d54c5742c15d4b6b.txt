WATCH ABOVE: North Vancouver police are warning about deadly contaminated drugs on the street. John Daly tells us why police and doctors believe these aren’t typical drug overdoses.

Police in North Vancouver have put out a warning about tainted street drugs.

Two people, a man and a woman in their 30s, were found dead on Monday after apparently inhaling some kind of illegal narcotics, possibly containing fentanyl.

Mounties are not saying where the two people were found and it’s not clear if this case is linked to a number of drug overdoses in Surrey last week.

Tests are being done to determine what exactly was in the drugs. While tests are underway, medical professionals say they are finding methamphetamine mixed with fentanyl and it can be a deadly combination.

“These two drug users fit the profile of people that we know are being affected by fentanyl contaminating the drug supply,” says Dr. Mark Lysyshyn, a medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health.

“They’re what we would consider, I guess, to be recreational drug users – using their drugs by smoking or inhaling or ingesting.”

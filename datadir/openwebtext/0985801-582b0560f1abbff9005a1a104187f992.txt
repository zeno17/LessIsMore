JDK 10 Rampdown Phase One: Process proposal

Per the JDK 10 schedule [1], we are now in Rampdown Phase One. The overall feature set is frozen. No further JEPs will be targeted to this release. The goal of this phase is the same as it was for JDK 9: Ensure that we fix the bugs that need to be fixed, and understand why we're not going to fix some bugs that perhaps ought to be fixed. I propose that we use the same process as in JDK 9, with one significant change: From this point forward any further enhancements require advance approval, using a simple request process along the lines of our other request processes. In such a short release cycle there's hardly any time to repair enhancements gone wrong, so let's keep an eye on them. I've drafted an RDP 1 page along with bug-deferral and late-enhancement process pages, based upon the corresponding JDK 9 pages, and posted them here: http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/rdp-1 http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/bug-deferral-process http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/late-enhancement-process JDK Committers are invited to comment on this process proposal. If no objections are raised in one week's time, by 17:00 UTC next Friday, 22 December, then this is the process that we'll use. Given that we're already in Rampdown Phase One, and that this process is nearly the same as that for JDK 9, I suggest that we start using this process immediately, prior to its formal approval. Let's not make any negative decisions involving the new aspect of the process, namely the approval of late enhancements, until the process has been approved. - Mark [1] http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/10/#Schedule

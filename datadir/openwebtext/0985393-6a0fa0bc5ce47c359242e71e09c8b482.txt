2017 has been another great year for music, and every Monday â€“ Thursday at 7:30pm Annie Mac has been playing out the biggest and most important tracks on the planet - her Hottest Record in the World.

With 2018 very nearly upon us we want to take the Hottest Record to a whole new level. For the first time ever we're throwing it open to you, the people, to help us choose our Hottest Record of the Year.

Annie has whittled all this year's records down to a shortlist of 40 big tunes, and now we need your help to pick a winner.

You can hear a clip from each of the contenders below, and then let us know who you think deserves the title of Hottest Record of the Year 2017.

Tune in to BBC Radio 1 at 7pm on Thursday 7th December, when Annie will be counting down the 20 Hottest Records of the Year and revealing the winner!

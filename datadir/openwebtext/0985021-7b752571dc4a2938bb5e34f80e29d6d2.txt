AMERICAN FORK, Utah- Four Utah teenagers have been cited for disorderly conduct after they rapped their order at a McDonald's drive-through.

The teens say they were imitating a popular video on YouTube. They rapped their order, which begins with, "I need a double cheeseburger and hold the lettuce ..." once quickly before repeating it more slowly.

Spencer Dauwalder says employees at the restaurant in American Fork told him and his friends they were holding up the line and needed to order or leave.

Dauwalder says nobody was in line. The group left without buying anything.

The teens were later cited by police officers who tracked them to a high-school volleyball match.

The Associated Press on Thursday left messages seeking comment with the American Fork police and Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's.

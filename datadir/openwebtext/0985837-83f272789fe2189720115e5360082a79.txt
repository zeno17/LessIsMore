Tiger Woods was on top of the golf world for so long that it’s natural to compare the younger generation of Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Jason Day and Rickie Fowler to Tiger. It’s already happened, and it’s going to continue to happen.

But one PGA Tour player thinks comparing the younger golfers to Tiger is a disservice to Woods’ accomplishments.

In an anonymous interview with ESPN’s Michael Collins, this golfer didn’t hold back, which is easy to do when there’s no name attached to it.

He said of Tiger via ESPN:

“He was the needle. He’s not around anymore. We don’t know if he’s coming around again. We hope [he will], but we can’t count on that. Now you take the Jordan Spieths, you take the Jason Days, you take these young guns, they’re still not Tiger. Nobody’s ever going to be Tiger. We know that. Lotta people don’t know that. But they’re not going to be. “The great play of Jason Day, the great play of Jordan Spieth, the great play of Rickie Fowler — combined, they’re not Tiger. … They’re just not. Tiger is Tiger. It’s a Michael Jordan. You cannot compare. It’s actually, in my opinion, it’s an embarrassment and an insult to compare those guys to a Tiger Woods. … It’s an absolute embarrassment to say that a Rory McIlroy, a Jason Day, a Jordan Spieth, Rickie Fowler, all these guys are going to compete with Tiger’s records. Combined, they don’t even have half his records yet.”

Yes, we won’t see another Tiger, but that shouldn’t take away from Spieth’s potential. Tiger and Spieth are the only players with at least seven wins before their 23rd birthday — there are similarities.

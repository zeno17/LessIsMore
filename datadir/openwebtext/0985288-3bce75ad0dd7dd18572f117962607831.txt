It’s crucial to make a good impression when you start a new job – but a rookie policeman ensured he will be the butt of jokes for years to come after mistaking the reflection of his patrol car for back-up.

Where’s a policeman when you need one? Right behind you – or so one office mistakenly thought.

The unnamed PC was one of several sent to investigate a late-night disturbance at an address in Hartlepool, Co. Durham, and radioed to tell HQ he was at the right address ‘because I can see another panda car’.

However, baffled control room staff told him his fellow officers were at the scene a few streets away.

It was only then he realised the other car was a reflection of his own in a shop window.

‘The poor guy took a bit of ribbing,’ Cleveland police said on Tuesday.

‘It was dark and the street lights made the reflection seem very real but it may be some time before he lives this one down.’

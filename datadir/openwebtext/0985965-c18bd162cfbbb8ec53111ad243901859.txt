June 28 (UPI) -- A daredevil wildlife expert in Australia was filmed diving head-first into a mud hole and emerging with a massive mud crab he caught bare-handed.

Beau Greaves posted a video to Facebook showing how he captured the gargantuan crustacean from its home inside a deep mud hole.

Greaves explains in the video, posted June 25, how he plans to use a small stick to distract the crab's claws and then puts his plan into action by diving head-first into the home.

The wildlife expert emerges with a mud crab so large his camera man cries out in shock.

"Another solid muddy up in the holes using my decoy stick, tried to explain it a little bit how to get them out," Greaves wrote on Facebook. "Been bitten twice, nearly lost a finger and been close to having my wrist crushed, but I guess the more you do it the better you get at it."

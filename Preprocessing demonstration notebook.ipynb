At the same time he elects to keep a secret journal. In his novel he subconsciously draws the portraits of the living people surrounding him.',\n",
       " ' On a wonderful afternoon, more than two years later, Lucia sat in the little Spanish courtyard that Gilbert had had built a few months after their marriage. The air was like golden wine, and she drank it in, bathed her soul in it, as though she could never find enough joy through these slow hours. How marvelous life had been to her in the last radiant months! She had realized the fulfillment of her most cherished dream, and looked down now at a tiny pink face that smiled at her.',\n",
       " ' Poor \"Red\" couldn\\'t have encountered the invalid at a less propitious moment; for he was almost knocked down by that crabbed gentleman.',\n",
       " ' Up North there was a man with a jaw like a rock, and hard, steel-gray eyes. He had his fingers on the pulse of business, and employed agents everywhere to serve his interests. His office in New York, in the heart of the great financial district, was like a telephone exchange--he the central who controlled the wires, put in and drew out the plugs, and played the fascinating game of connecting himself with any \"party\" he thought worth while. A shrewd, inveterate gambler, he was without scruples. He lived for one purpose: to make money. For one person: Morgan Pell.',\n",
       " ' When Lucia saw Gilbert pass the paper to her husband, she thought she could not stand it. It was not her concern; and yet it was. Vitally, whatever affected young Jones affected her. She could not see him tricked, duped. And she knew that he was being played with, made a fool of. Some ulterior motive lay beneath this seeming generosity. She tried to control herself; but suddenly she found herself speaking.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Ave you?\" the bandit turned on Pell. \"\\'Ave you made a will?\" His tone was incisive. \"Do not lie.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'E cannot be happy until \\'e pay you back.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'E who bids ze \\'ighest,\" Lopez elucidated, \"shall \\'ave ze little paper and shall come wiz me while I show \\'im where ze oil she is \\'iding.\" He flicked the ashes of his cigarette upon the floor, and sat on the corner of the table, one foot dangling in the air.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Im too?\" asked Pedro, indicating Morgan Pell who stood, as though made of stone, in one corner.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Red\\'! save me, save me!\" Angela cried in melodramatic fashion.',\n",
       " '\"\\'Red,\\'\" said Gilbert after a brief silence, \"I was hoping to be able to pay you off to-day.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'Way down below,\" laughed Lopez, delighted at his ability to pun in English, and making a motion with one hand toward the nether regions.',\n",
       " '\"--an\\' I\\'m goin\\' to find out what\\'s what!\" Uncle Henry went on, as though he had not been interrupted.',\n",
       " '\"--making him a very rich man indeed,\" Pell added, significantly.',\n",
       " '\"A Mr. and Mrs. Pell, from New York. They\\'re lookin\\' over property round here.... But I don\\'t care, Angy. Even if I had to go to Bisbee four times a day and get some good-lookin\\' folks to bring down the road, I\\'d do it if you\\'d wave to me! Oh, why can\\'t you always be nice to me?\"',\n",
       " '\"A free country?\" she said.',\n",
       " '\"A friend o\\' mine. Only seventy years old, too. He was right in the prime of life.\"',\n",
       " '\"A friend of mine!\" cried Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"A girl? What use I \\'ave for girls?\" laughed Pancho Lopez. \"What you say now--what\\'s ze name?\"',\n",
       " '\"A go?\" yelled Uncle Henry, unable to restrain himself. \"It\\'s gone!\"',\n",
       " '\"A hundred and eleven!\" Hardy pushed ahead.',\n",
       " '\"A hundred and fifty!\" Pell was saying.',\n",
       " '\"A hundred and fifty-one!\" the cautious Hardy added.',\n",
       " '\"A hundred and twenty-five!\" Pell yelled. \"And what do you know about that?\"',\n",
       " '\"A hundred dollars a month punching cows? With her in a boarding-house in Bisbee? A nice life, isn\\'t it? Do you care to think of it, both of you?\"',\n",
       " '\"A little,\" Lucia managed to say.',\n",
       " '\"A loan fish! You loan money. And when ze people cannot pay, you convict zem and take zeir ranchos.\"',\n",
       " '\"A lot of gol darn sand!\" the invalid whined.',\n",
       " '\"A man to see me on a matter of business,\" Gilbert remembered. \"Will you excuse me?\" He turned to Pell.',\n",
       " '\"A million!\" said Lopez, his eyes big.',\n",
       " '\"A rich marriage,\" Uncle Henry went on, almost smacking his lips over the words.',\n",
       " '\"A what?\"',\n",
       " '\"About my not coming to say good-bye?\"',\n",
       " '\"About what, Uncle?\"',\n",
       " '\"Absogoshdarnlutely!\" Uncle Henry relieved the tension by saying.',\n",
       " '\"Absolutely! Will you?\" Uncle Henry had the temerity to say.',\n",
       " '\"Absolutely! You were the sole support of an invalid uncle.\" He waited for the truth of this remark to sink in; but Gilbert said nothing. \"And on top of that,\" Uncle Henry went on, rapidly, when his nephew did not speak, \"you were engaged in an essential industry--if you can call these rotten steaks you feed us on essential. The bones is softer than the meat.\" He gave a curious little laugh, thin and high.',\n",
       " '\"Absolutely!\" Uncle Henry was quick to answer.',\n",
       " '\"Absolutely,\" the old man affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"Absolutely?\"',\n",
       " '\"Adios, my frands! And may you always be so \\'appy like what I \\'ave make you!\"',\n",
       " '\"Admitted it!\" Gilbert cried, his rage now at the boiling point.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! All kinds you \\'ave \\'ere, eh? Good! An\\' what \\'er name?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ah! I sought so,\" said Lopez, much pleased.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! Ze food!\" Pancho cried. \"Good! Put zem zere!\" he ordered; and the cook placed the tray closer to him. Then he turned to Lucia Pell. \"You shall wait on me,\" he told her, as though he were conferring the greatest honor upon her.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! but you do!\" Lopez insisted.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! for the love of God!\" came from Pell, who had half risen. At that instant Pedro shot from his hip at the debased creature. The form stiffened and collapsed like a bag, falling partially under the table.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! it ees so easy!\" laughed the bandit.',\n",
       " '\"Ah! my frand!\" Pancho said, as he bowed again, \"How glad am I to see you. You glad to see me, too, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ah! my young lady. We shall see.\" He turned abruptly, and called, \"Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"Ah! to you, perhaps! It is ze difference between zose who live in safety and zose who live in danger. In safety you \\'ave ze bill to pay. You pay it and you forget it. In danger you \\'ave enemy to kill. You kill \\'im an\\' you forget \\'im. Save?\" And another heaping knifeful of the chile con carne went into his mouth.',\n",
       " '\"Ah!\" yelled Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Ain\\'t we ever goin\\' to finish our supper?\" Uncle Henry wanted to know; but his tone was not querulous; it was plaintively sweet, and it held a note of invitation for everyone.',\n",
       " '\"Ain\\'t you?\" Uncle Henry cried.',\n",
       " '\"Ain\\'t yuh goin\\' to do it?\" Uncle Henry asked.',\n",
       " '\"Alive!\" he said. \"Oh, it can\\'t be!\"',\n",
       " '\"All right,\" Lucia Pell said. But she turned away.',\n",
       " '\"All right?\" said Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"All those?\"',\n",
       " '\"Alone?\" Pell followed up.',\n",
       " '\"Also you make love to my frand, Señor Jones.\"',\n",
       " '\"Also, you \\'ave ze bad temper.\"',\n",
       " '\"An attractive woman never gets the worst of it in court,\" Pell coldly stated. \"Suppose we settle that--right here and now. It will give you ready money. And it will save me from having to pay perhaps a greater sum--later. That is....\"',\n",
       " '\"An idea!... Mebbe he\\'d lend you some.\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' I hear they eat frogs, an\\' hosses, an\\' cheese with worms in it, too. Say,\" the old man wanted to know, \"what don\\'t they eat over there?... An\\' speakin\\' of eatin\\', ain\\'t we never goin\\' to have no dinner?\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' have six children.\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' we\\'re goin\\' to get skinned out of millions! Oh, my Gawd!\" The poor old invalid wailed it out, and rocked himself in his chair. How he wished he could rise, step out on the floor and knock Pell and Hardy down! Why didn\\'t his strong and husky young nephew do it? What was the matter with the present generation, anyhow? Wasn\\'t there any red blood in it? If he had only been younger, and strong, able to fight for what he knew to be his rights! But here he was, tied down in a wheel chair, trapped, helpless, impotent.',\n",
       " '\"An\\' what about your uncle?\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' what heez name?\"',\n",
       " '\"An\\' why not?\" Lopez asked.',\n",
       " '\"And I\\'m simply famished. Who wouldn\\'t be, after such a glorious ride!\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"And a gol darn nice fellow, too,\" Uncle Henry went on. \"A little careless, but--\"',\n",
       " '\"And because you are marry, you cannot speak of love?... Eet is strange customs. Tell me, señora, what does your marriage service say?\"',\n",
       " '\"And before I go,\" Pell went on, \"there\\'s a matter of business I want to talk over with you. So if this gentleman is through--\" he indicated Hardy with his thumb.',\n",
       " '\"And here\\'s mine!\" Angela, not to be outdone, piped up, presenting her child, also in her arms, to the delirious bandit.',\n",
       " '\"And no grass nor nothin\\',\" the invalid retorted. \"Not even a place to go fishin\\'. And you call it beau--Say, was you ever in Bangor?\"',\n",
       " '\"And now, what you say? You all \\'appy, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"And planty more what I shall steal for you myself personal. Now zen, is all right? You \\'ave ze money, ze lady, everyzing.\" Surely there was nothing lacking, Lopez tried to make it plain, for complete happiness. There were no bars now in the path of content.',\n",
       " '\"And she love you?\" Lopez went on.',\n",
       " '\"And this is why you were so anxious to come here,\" she said, very low; yet everyone heard her statement. \"To dig around, and then, if you found oil, to try to buy this place! Oh, I thought better of you than that, Morgan! What a trick--what a dishonorable trick!\" She shuddered away from him. She almost hated him in this revealing moment.',\n",
       " '\"And we are free to go?\" Lucia cried, unbelieving.',\n",
       " '\"And we\\'re not all as discreet as you!\" Pell flung back. \"And now, if you don\\'t mind,\" he added insinuatingly, \"I\\'d like to talk to my wife--alone.\"',\n",
       " '\"And which is \\'e?\"',\n",
       " '\"And whose life you save!\" Lopez added.',\n",
       " '\"And why not, I\\'d like to know?\" Pell inquired. \"Who\\'s he, anyhow, and what difference does it make?\"',\n",
       " '\"And why not?\" the bandit asked. He was thoroughly weary of Gilbert\\'s dilly-dallying, so foreign to his own philosophy.',\n",
       " '\"And why not?\" was all her husband said. \"Hadn\\'t I a right to look for oil here? Suppose it was on the place?\"',\n",
       " '\"And why?\" he inquired.',\n",
       " '\"And yet you \\'ave divorce!\"',\n",
       " '\"And you ain\\'t going to rob him, after all?\" Uncle Henry piped up.',\n",
       " '\"And you ain\\'t got anything more to say, Jones?\" He watched him closely.',\n",
       " '\"And you didn\\'t like it?\" Angela persisted, moving her little stool even closer to him.',\n",
       " '\"And you don\\'t even get excited?\"',\n",
       " '\"And you have annoyed him in other ways.\"',\n",
       " '\"And you\\'d throw me, old and sick, a invalid, out into the streets?\" Uncle Henry whined. No one could get more pathos into his tones than Uncle Henry when he wanted to do so.',\n",
       " '\"And your equity?\" Pell pursued, businesslike enough now.',\n",
       " '\"Angela!\" cried the enraptured \"Red.\" He went over to her, grasped her around the waist, and led her to the window.',\n",
       " '\"Angely! Angely!\"',\n",
       " '\"Another ten thousand.\"',\n",
       " '\"Answer me: how much is it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Any stronger cord on the place anywhere?\" Gilbert looked around the room. Maybe one of the many Indian jugs contained a string. \"Red\" and he had a habit of putting any old thing in them.',\n",
       " '\"Anything but,\" the latter answered.',\n",
       " '\"As I say, no trouble for me,\" Lopez boyishly said, and smiled, shrugging his broad shoulders.',\n",
       " '\"As I was going to say--\" Hardy started, when Uncle Henry interrupted him with:',\n",
       " '\"As long as I get there by eight, what difference does that make?\" Pell asked.',\n",
       " '\"As though I should ever need reminding! How dull you men can be! But I don\\'t want to take them from you, Gil.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ask him about marryin\\'--you know. I gotter find out because Hardy\\'s comin\\'.\" No speech could have been plainer and balder. \"Did you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ask him!\" Uncle Henry said. \"An\\' I only hope to thunder he tells a lie!\" His voice went up on a high key.',\n",
       " '\"Ask who what?\" Lucia asked. She was not a little interested now. She came back into the room.',\n",
       " '\"Auction?\" Pell repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Aw, come on!\" poor \"Red\" begged.',\n",
       " '\"Aw, that\\'s all right,\" \"Red\" said. He didn\\'t like to be thanked, and he avoided even the shadow of sentimentality with Jones. After all, they were two young fellows, playing a big game together, taking big chances; and what was the use of talking about it? \"What are you going to tell the Pells?\" he suddenly asked, glad to get off the immediate subject.',\n",
       " '\"Azcooze, my general,\" he said. His chief turned. \"It is ze damn ranger. Zey is after us some more.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" Pell scornfully ejaculated.',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" cried Lopez. \"Zen I take her!\"',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"Be off wid yez!\" she always began by saying. But the insinuating harmonica was his only reply; and she ended by begging him to come in and play for her while she messed with the pots and pans, and maybe found some batter for a plate of griddle cakes.',\n",
       " '\"Be off, now! Ye\\'ve got some travelin\\' to do before ye\\'re able to win Angela. Then ye can think of buyin\\' a ranch.\"',\n",
       " '\"Beautiful!\" Uncle Henry went on, repeating the word in derision. \"What\\'s beautiful about it? That\\'s what I\\'d like to know.\"',\n",
       " '\"Because I\\'ve heard that you kill people,\" she bravely told him.',\n",
       " '\"Because he ain\\'t talked of nothin\\' else for six months. You wasn\\'t thinkin\\' of doin\\' it, was you?\" He hung on Gilbert\\'s answer.',\n",
       " '\"Because she told me, that\\'s how! And if only the gol darn fool would do it like I want him to--\" He addressed himself suddenly to his nephew, who now stood on the other side of the table: \"Aw, come on. Be a good feller, won\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because the minute you begin to take life seriously, it takes you that way, and then--\"',\n",
       " '\"Because there was no decent hotel anywhere near. I couldn\\'t do less than offer them what little hospitality I had, could I, when Sturgis suggested it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because you \\'ave never really lived,\" the bandit explained. \"Because you \\'ave been always protect by ozzers. I kill only men. And only evil men. And when I kill evil man, it make me very \\'appy. For I \\'ave did a good deed.\" His simple philosophy pleased him.',\n",
       " '\"Blamed if I know, Angy! Thanks, Mrs. Quinn.\"',\n",
       " '\"Boo!\" came from Lucia softly. She laughed, and ran up the tiny stone stairs that led to her room.',\n",
       " '\"Boo, yourself!\" called out Uncle Henry, determined to have the last word, as Lucia disappeared. Then he turned querulously on his nephew, as soon as he was certain she was out of hearing. \"Why did you ever invite \\'em to stay here in the first place?\" he wanted to know. The sound of \"Red\\'s\" harmonica was heard outside.',\n",
       " '\"Bueno! We begin,\" said the bandit. He called through the door: \"Pedro! Bring zem all in again.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bueno. I go,\" said Lopez, and started toward the door. Then he turned to Gilbert. \"Astuavago adios. Maybe we will meet again, maybe no. Quien sabe?\" He waved his hand, gave one last look at Pell\\'s limp form, and cried, \"Adios!\" He was gone--vanished like a ghost.',\n",
       " '\"Bullet?\" asked Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"But I better make sure,\" said \"Red,\" kneeling beside the body. \"Right in the head. Not a chance.\" He was peering down at the gaunt face. \"No, not a chance when you get it there.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I can earn money,\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"But I do wish to live!\" Lucia cried in desperation; and her hands went out in an attitude of supplication.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t know that there\\'s oil here,\" Pell argued.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t see why--\" the unremitting Angela started to say.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t understand ...\"',\n",
       " '\"But I left the foreman and the cook,\" Gilbert reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"But I want to see!\" cried Angela, dancing with excitement now.',\n",
       " '\"But I want to talk to you myself,\" the latter reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"But I was here first,\" Morgan Pell argued. He hated to be beaten by this stripling.',\n",
       " '\"But I\\'ve lost the place.\" He pointed to the little clock that was ticking out its relentless minutes. \"It\\'s after eight o\\'clock.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I--\" Hardy began.',\n",
       " '\"But I--\" Pell started to say.',\n",
       " '\"But I--must pay him back,\" Gilbert wanted to make it clear.',\n",
       " '\"But Mexico! How different!\" Lopez said, paying no more attention to Angela than he would to a fly.',\n",
       " '\"But don\\'t you see what it would mean to you, dear Gil? To have someone always here; to kiss you when you go; to greet you when you come back; to laugh with you when you are glad; and comfort you when things go wrong. To give you the sympathy, the understanding that a man finds only in a woman\\'s heart. Don\\'t you see, Gil?\"',\n",
       " '\"But he seems to be,\" said the shrewd Angela, looking at Morgan Pell with his wily countenance.',\n",
       " '\"But he want you. And so ...\"',\n",
       " '\"But he\\'s a fine young feller, if I do say so!\" Uncle Henry came to Gilbert\\'s rescue, after the manner of all relatives when an outsider steps in with criticism.',\n",
       " '\"But he\\'s my nevyer!\"',\n",
       " '\"But how could he have moved?\" \"Red\" exclaimed. \"He\\'s dead, I say!\"',\n",
       " '\"But how did you get ahead so fast?\" young Jones wanted to know. \"That\\'s what sticks me.\"',\n",
       " '\"But how? How do you work it?\" Gilbert inquired, his brain in a tumult.',\n",
       " '\"But if I should give you a gun, you might shoot me wiz it!\" Lopez laughed.',\n",
       " '\"But if you\\'ll--\" the old man pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"But if you\\'ve been raiding around here,\" Uncle Henry said from his seclusion, \"won\\'t the rangers be after you?\"',\n",
       " '\"But is it all right?\" the young man persisted.',\n",
       " '\"But it isn\\'t getting us anywhere--just to sit around and complain,\" his nephew tried to pacify him, rising, and starting toward him again; but Uncle Henry didn\\'t want to be so near him, knowing what he was going to say next. Therefore he switched adroitly to the door, and let out, \"No, it ain\\'t gettin\\' us anywhere; but it would if you\\'d marry Angela Hardy, like I want you to!\" He was a little frightened now that he had uttered the words, and he looked anxiously at Gilbert to see their effect. The latter remained as calm as ever. \"But I don\\'t love her,\" was all he said.',\n",
       " '\"But it seems so cold-blooded!\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"But it was what he done!\"',\n",
       " '\"But it won\\'t grow nothin\\'--not even rocks, an\\' you know it,\" the occupant of the wheel chair said. Then a new thought came to him, and he shot out, \"By golly, I got it! He\\'s an oil man, ain\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"But it\\'s legal!\" Pell fired back. \"And what do I care--what does anybody care--so long as it\\'s legal! Ha! the courts would be with me! Moreover, it\\'s the way you get the clothes you wear and the food you eat, and all those jewels that you hang on yourself when you undress and go to the opera!\"',\n",
       " '\"But officer--\" began Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"But she,\" went on Uncle Henry, just as if nothing had been said, and pointing to Lucia, \"is married to him,\" indicating Pell. \"Which makes it a hell of a mess all around!\" He leaned back in his chair as if he had done a good day\\'s work.',\n",
       " '\"But since to you gentlemen it seem so excitable--I \\'ave it.\"',\n",
       " '\"But that isn\\'t honest!\" Lucia fearlessly said. \"It\\'s as crooked as it can be! And you know it.\"',\n",
       " '\"But to kill a man--like that! In cold blood!\" Hardy gasped. \"Oh, it\\'s horrible!\"',\n",
       " '\"But we shall not talk of me,\" Lopez said. \"We shall spik of you. \\'Ow you been since I seen you, what?\" He tossed away his cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"But what in the world could anybody be taking specimens of the soil around here for?\" he inquired, and then began to think.',\n",
       " '\"But what was he shooting at?\" \"Red\" asked.',\n",
       " '\"But when we are enjoying his hospitality--\"',\n",
       " '\"But where did you get the money?\" Gilbert asked, incredulously.',\n",
       " '\"But who decides whether a man is good or evil\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"But who does it belong to?\" the Mexican wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"But whose bag is it?\" Gilbert persisted.',\n",
       " '\"But you just said--\" Angela started to remind him, and took a little stool and moved close to him, seating herself upon it. She did not want him to forget her girlish sweetness. Lopez paid no heed to her.',\n",
       " '\"But you might at least be--\" his daughter began once more.',\n",
       " '\"But you said you didn\\'t believe ...\" he began; but Pell came mercilessly back at him!',\n",
       " '\"But you said--\" Gilbert began.',\n",
       " '\"But you touched my hand many a time, in the old days,\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"But you won\\'t!\" Jasper Hardy quickly said, glancing at the clock which ticked on, inexorably.',\n",
       " '\"But you wouldn\\'t do that,\" she cried out.',\n",
       " '\"But--while we--\" Lucia started to argue, and then thought better of it.',\n",
       " '\"By gollies, he\\'s got it again!\" Uncle Henry yelled, in desperation. He switched his chair around, and faced Gilbert. \"Why didn\\'t you tear it up while he was dead?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"By golly!\" \"Red\" exclaimed, on his knees, his hand on Pell\\'s white face.',\n",
       " '\"Can I? If you think not waving to you is cruelty, you ought to see some of my other forms of torture.\"',\n",
       " '\"Can\\'t stop,\" Bradley waved him aside. \"Now we gotter get him.\" He went out as swiftly as he had come in. Every instant was precious. There was not a second to be lost.',\n",
       " '\"Can\\'t you guess?\" asked \"Red,\" coming forward, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly I do,\" the other answered.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly I don\\'t believe it. My confidence in my wife is implicit.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not! I\\'m only twenty!\" She was swift with the denial.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not!\" Gilbert was instantly saying, and glared at his uncle. The latter, as usual, plunged straight ahead, as the others now gathered about the room. \"He,\" meaning \"Red,\" \"loves her. He,\" he nodded toward his nephew, \"loves her,\" pointing to Lucia Pell. \"And she loves him,\" nodding back to Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not!\" Uncle Henry went on. \"I got a gun here and I--\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not,\" Pell was quick to satisfy him. \"Only why didn\\'t you say so before?\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not,\" was the immediate reply.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not. What are you raving about, anyhow? Cut out this sort of talk, Uncle. You\\'re getting on my nerves.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly wheels a mean chair,\" he said good-naturedly to Gilbert, as he watched Uncle Henry steer himself out to the gate. \"Got his cut-out open, too! Pesky to-day, ain\\'t he? That\\'s one reason I came back.\" He spread his legs apart, and fanned himself with his hat. He ran his fingers through his thick, violent crop of hair. \"A mean Arizona day!\" he said. \"The walk made me hot.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly!\" said Angela, coming over to him. \"You\\'re a boob, \\'Red,\\' and if you don\\'t look out, there\\'s a fellow over at Bisbee who--\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly. I must go and pack anyway.\" And she started toward the steps that led upstairs.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly; when I die,\" answered Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"Ciertamente no!\" the bandit said.',\n",
       " '\"Ciertamente!\" the bandit stated, as though they were talking of the weather. \"You capture ze preesoner. You \\'ave no jail to put \\'im in. You pack him around wiz you. If you let \\'im go, \\'e come back to fight you again. So you kill him. Eet is very simple.\"',\n",
       " '\"Come, \\'Red,\\'\" said the girl, as she started to follow her father. What else was there to do?',\n",
       " '\"Company, my dear sir,\" Pell quickly retorted, not a little annoyed at the question; and he glared at the old man. He had had two days of him, and was getting used to him. Lucia, who had remained silent by the door, saw the cloud on her husband\\'s face, and gave a little, startled \"Oh!\" It was hardly more than a whisper, but Pell was swift to catch it. He turned on her, and took in her radiant figure.',\n",
       " '\"Could not t\\'ink,\" Lopez insisted.',\n",
       " '\"Could not,\" the Mexican answered.',\n",
       " '\"Couldn\\'t sleep a wink,\" he said. \"This cursed heat, you know. Glad I don\\'t have to live in this part of the world all the time.\"',\n",
       " '\"Dad\\'s awfully hard about holding to a bargain,\" Angela reminded him. \"He\\'s all business. He wasn\\'t that way until after Ma died. I do wish he\\'d be more human. I\\'ve talked to him and talked to him, until I\\'m tired; but he\\'s getting harder all the time. This is the last day, isn\\'t it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Debommultalo!\" his henchman replied.',\n",
       " '\"Despues de la comida,\" said Pedro.',\n",
       " '\"Did I not tell you for kill zis man?\" said Lopez, pointing in disgust to Morgan Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Did you ask him?\" Uncle Henry went on, paying not the slightest heed to her surprised glance.',\n",
       " '\"Did you call me?\" she wanted to know, looking at all three.',\n",
       " '\"Dinner ought to be ready now,\" Gilbert answered patiently, never looking up from his paper.',\n",
       " '\"Dirt?\" Gilbert said, not understanding.',\n",
       " '\"Do not ask me.\" He caught sight of \"Red.\" \"Ze next is you.\" He appraised him rapidly, and then said to Gilbert, \"\\'E is frand for you, no?\"',\n",
       " '\"Do what?\" Angela pursued.',\n",
       " '\"Do what?\" Pell asked, jerking out the two words in a high staccato. He hated to be questioned, particularly by his wife. His hands reached for the satchel he had brought in.',\n",
       " '\"Do you mean to say you\\'re going to set here and get throwed out into the street and not even try to do something?\"',\n",
       " '\"Do you think I want my darter to marry a gol darn fool?\" Hardy fired back at the old man.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think they can hit him?\" Angela cried.',\n",
       " '\"Does he--does he love her?\" Lucia brought herself to ask.',\n",
       " '\"Does life mean as little to you as that?\" Lucia asked another question. This man was an enigma. He was bad through and through. They were as helpless as cattle in his hands.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t mind Uncle Henry,\" Gilbert said to Lucia. \"He\\'s got a heart of gold, but he can be cranky and eccentric sometimes. Maybe he\\'s got one of his moods to-day. I never know. Tomorrow he\\'ll be all right--perhaps. I hope so, anyhow.... But come inside. You must be tired after your trip. Your rooms are upstairs.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t remember!\" Uncle Henry yelled. \"But that\\'s what I left you here for! We had it all framed up! Why didn\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t shoot!\" cried the bandit. And he laughed outright, almost doubling up with mirth.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t worry,\" he reassured her, and patted her little hand, so warm on his arm. He turned to Pell. \"You city fellers needn\\'t think you can come down here and put it all over us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you call the United States a free country?\" Lucia asked him.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you know?\" he asked, and looked her straight in the eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you shush me, gol darn it!\" cried Uncle Henry, crumpling the newspaper in his hand and throwing it on the floor. The heat was affecting him. \"I\\'ve kep\\' still long enough, an\\'--\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you suppose I do? Don\\'t you suppose I\\'ve always understood, ever since--\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t--don\\'t speak to me!\" Angela sniffed, and stamped her dainty foot. \"Don\\'t look at me! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you all!\" Blinded with rage and tears, she crossed the room, and stumbled directly into Uncle Henry\\'s chair, and all but tipped him over. \"Red\" followed her, solicitously.',\n",
       " '\"Drink?\" yelled Uncle Henry from his chair, frantic at the thought of any more of their precious liquor being consumed. It was hard enough to get, even when one had plenty of money.',\n",
       " '\"Drunk?\" Pell asked.',\n",
       " '\"Easier than a fellow in Bisbee--maybe. Better look out, \\'Red,\\' or I\\'ll sue Mrs. Quinn for alienation of affections!\"',\n",
       " '\"East?\" \"Red\" asked. He had seated himself at the table, and picked up Gilbert\\'s pen, and began making curious little scrawls with it on a piece of paper, as a business man sometimes does when he is telephoning.',\n",
       " '\"Easy!\" Gilbert repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Ees a prison for ze soul!\" Lopez affirmed. \"A stupid, seely place, your New York!\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees bum shooting! If she \\'appen some more, zen I \\'ave for get new Pedro. Should be too bad. Especially for you. You onnerstand?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees idea what I get from ze moving pitchers.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees life too horrible?\" Pancho wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Ees no difference from us three--me, you, and \\'im,\" Lopez explained. \"You is afraid for kill. \\'E was afraid for die. Me, I am afraid for neizer! Now zen, what you do, eh?\" He patted Gilbert on the shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"Ees no way for pliz you. If I do not kill ze \\'usband, ees all wrong. If I do kill ze \\'usband, ees all wrong. Say,\" he looked at him in confusion, \"what ze \\'ell shall I do wiz ze damn \\'usband, anyway?\" He puckered his brow.',\n",
       " '\"Ees pretty old,\" laughed Lopez. \"Let me see your teeth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees recipe,\" Lopez affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"Ees too bad,\" said Lopez, nonchalantly. \"But nozzing to get excite about.\"',\n",
       " '\"Eight o\\'clock to-night?\" his uncle cried, and leaned so far out of his chair that he was in danger of falling to the floor.',\n",
       " '\"Eight o\\'clock!\" Hardy cried. \"And the place belongs to me!\" He turned to Pell. \"Anything more from you?\" he inquired, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Enjoying? Ha! Suffering, I guess you mean!\" And Pell\\'s head went back and he gave out a guffaw.',\n",
       " '\"Even you?\" Gilbert inquired, puzzled.',\n",
       " '\"Ever since when, Gil? Then you have known such a woman?\"',\n",
       " '\"Everything?\" he said, significantly; and his eyes became two narrow slits as he looked at her.',\n",
       " '\"Exactly. Will you take it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Exemption?\" Gilbert repeated the word, a little angry at its utterance. This wasn\\'t like Uncle Henry who, with all his peculiarities, had always been a patriot.',\n",
       " '\"Fair?\" Lopez rolled the word over.',\n",
       " '\"Finished?\" asked Pell.',\n",
       " '\"First time I use a knife in long while!\" he laughed, as he stood up to the job. \"Now we all eat much; an\\' mebbe give some to leetle Pancho and Panchita too, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"First you won\\'t marry Hardy\\'s daughter and now you won\\'t ask him for money,\" Uncle Henry pursued the subject.',\n",
       " '\"For \\'im,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"For me New York can go to \\'ell just as soon as she damn please!\" the bandit let out.',\n",
       " '\"For me you name him?\" Lopez finally got out. \"Oh, too good you are to me. Pancho! my own leetle boy! Pancho! \\'Some\\' name, what you say, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"For me?\" cried Uncle Henry, joyfully.',\n",
       " '\"For the love of Mike, quit your babbling! Sssh!\"',\n",
       " '\"For why? It is not my habit. I give not a damn for any man.\" He snapped his fingers, as though at life itself.',\n",
       " '\"Fortunately for us, my dear,\" he said. \"For now we are certain not to be disturbed while working out a sensible solution of our little problem.\" He had forgotten the pain in his head. He lighted a cigarette, casually, slowly. \"You will of course sue for divorce,\" he went on, blowing a ring to the ceiling and watching it ascend. \"But there\\'ll be no difficulty about that. I shall not contest,\" he added magnanimously.',\n",
       " '\"Friend of yours?\" said Morgan Pell, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"From what my frand tell me, I can see now \\'ow you make your money,\" the bandit told Hardy. \"You are a robber.\"',\n",
       " '\"Gad!\" Pell let out. His hands went together, his jaw set. Things were coming out beautifully.',\n",
       " '\"Gee! you make a feller happy, Mrs. Quinn!\" said the appreciative \"Red,\" sitting down, and getting busy, \"Won\\'t you come to Bisbee with Angela an\\' me the next time we go to the movies?\"',\n",
       " '\"Geemoneddy!\" Uncle Henry broke the tension.',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" cried Lucia, in mortal terror.',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" she cried out; and anguish was hers--a deep, horrible moment of suffering. It was all up with them. They were as helpless as Pell had been with the bandit a few hours before. Caught, ensnared, trapped!',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" she cried.',\n",
       " '\"Gil--\" the girl got out the first syllable of his name, and no more; for her little handkerchief was at her pretty nose.',\n",
       " '\"Give him his ranch back, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"Give me a gun, too!\" the fool prayed.',\n",
       " '\"Give me that water,\" Bradley continued. \"I want to get him in alive if I can. All the more credit to me and my men, you see.\"',\n",
       " '\"Give you a gun! Pedro!\" The man had evidently been just outside the door, and came in at once. \"Pedro, you \\'ear?\" And Pedro grinned.',\n",
       " '\"Glad?\" exclaimed Gilbert. \"I could kiss you, Pancho! But where on earth have you been? Come in, and tell us everything.\"',\n",
       " '\"Go on--you ask \\'em!\" suggested Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Go?\" he asked. \"What do you mean?\"',\n",
       " '\"Gol darn, the gol darn--\" cried Uncle Henry; and then he swerved on Jasper Hardy: \"Maybe you can persuade him,\" he suggested.',\n",
       " '\"Good Lord!\" was all Gilbert could utter.',\n",
       " '\"Good Lord!\" was all young Jones could say, and he put his hand to his head.',\n",
       " '\"Good afternoon, Mr. Pell,\" said old Smith to the newcomer.',\n",
       " '\"Good morning, Lucia,\" Gilbert said, hardly daring to look at her.',\n",
       " '\"Good!\" laughed Lopez. \"She is did.\"',\n",
       " '\"Good!\" smiled Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Gosh! ain\\'t it hot!\" finally came from Uncle Henry, his voice a drawl.',\n",
       " '\"Got any water?\" Bradley asked.',\n",
       " '\"Got it in the head, eh?\" the ranger went on, looking down at Pell, but with no pity in his face. He was too accustomed to death. A man who had been killed was just another \"case\" to him--one of an endless row of corpses.',\n",
       " '\"Got what?\" his nephew asked.',\n",
       " '\"Guess!\" said Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Gun?\"',\n",
       " '\"H\\'m!\" Lopez murmured. \"You have given me a idea.\" He rubbed his hands together, and then pushed his big sombrero a little back on his forehead. \"Better as my own. I shall use it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha! You\\'ve had your turn, my lady! Now, it\\'s mine! And after all I\\'ve done for you, you ungrateful hussy!\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha!\" The bandit saw his chance. \"Is it possible all ze law what you love is not so damn wise, after all?\" He was tickled at his own perspicacity. \"However, it makes no never mind. You shall still be rich any\\'ow. I shall send back all ze cattle what I steal from you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha!\" laughed Lopez. \"If I am ever caught, I shall be \\'anged many times!\"',\n",
       " '\"Hallo, Oncle Hennery,\" he greeted the old man in the wheel chair. \"You look splendid! And \\'allo, \\'Red,\\'--zat\\'s what zey call you--yes?\" Then he saw the babies, and his eyes fairly popped from his head, \"Well, well!\" he cried, \"Who \\'ave zese leetle fellers!\"',\n",
       " '\"Hardly!\" with a smile.',\n",
       " '\"Has it gone off yet?\" she naïvely asked.',\n",
       " '\"Has it got a kick in it?\" the other wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Has what gone off?\" from Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Have a good nap?\" Gilbert inquired; but he really didn\\'t care at all. Pell, however, took his question seriously.',\n",
       " '\"Have you any objections?\" Pell said, curling his lip. The irony in his tone was unmistakable.',\n",
       " '\"Have you got the money?\"',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t got a drink, have you, while we\\'re waiting? Not that I need an appetizer! And it\\'s damned hot, I know, to guzzle whiskey.\"',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t you any laws in Mexico?\" Lucia inquired.',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t you heard? Lopez has broken off the reservation again.\"',\n",
       " '\"Having you here is all the thanks I want,\" he answered. He had everything snugly packed now.',\n",
       " '\"He certainly is,\" answered young Jones promptly. \"About the best I ever had.\" He wasn\\'t going to see anything happen to the faithful \"Red.\" He\\'d have protected him with his own life.',\n",
       " '\"He is my husband,\" Lucia then found herself saying. \"I am now Mrs. Pell.\"',\n",
       " '\"He means it, Gil!\" Lucia cried, and threw herself into her lover\\'s arms. She would die, if he died--she would die with him.',\n",
       " '\"He moved!\" cried Uncle Henry, excited now, and rising in his chair, which he wheeled out into the room.',\n",
       " '\"He says he can fix it,\" Uncle Henry said. \"Let him try. He\\'s done swell so far. Personally, I got a lot o\\' confidence in that feller. He\\'s slick, he is!\"',\n",
       " '\"He shall go free,\" Lopez announced.',\n",
       " '\"He takes it sort o\\' hard, don\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"He tries so hard to imitate you in everything. It makes me ache to see how happy he is, Gil. Aren\\'t they the cutest couple you ever saw? And won\\'t it be nice when Pancho and Panchita are old enough to play together?\"',\n",
       " '\"He wants to buy this ranch because there\\'s oil here!\" Uncle Henry went on, not dismayed in the least at the other\\'s insult.',\n",
       " '\"He won\\'t bother us,\" \"Red\" smiled, settling back again. \"Nothin\\' to steal here except the mortgage.\" He paused, as though in deep thought; but Gilbert, had he known it, was thinking even harder. Lopez, the Mexican bandit, was a dim uncertainty; the mortgage was a stern reality.',\n",
       " '\"He won\\'t?\" she finally said.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s dead, just as I say,\" Lopez stated. \"Pedro never misses.\"',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s down in the shed--fixin\\',\" the old man informed him.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s gone?\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s got a chance to make a swell marriage,\" announced Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s got him!\" came from Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s my uncle,\" young Jones answered.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s richer\\'n mud,\" Uncle Henry declared.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s wounded,\" said Lucia, going to the door. \"You can\\'t take him--like that!\" she exclaimed. She longed for Lopez to turn and look at her; yet she longed, oddly enough, that he would not do so in the next second. It would be as difficult for her, as for him, if they saw each other. Her heart went out to him--this friend of Gilbert\\'s--and hers.',\n",
       " '\"He--he wants you to--to marry Angela Hardy, don\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"Hello, Gil!\" she said, beating her riding-crop on her boot, and smiling that entrancing smile of hers. She was glad to see her handsome host again after her brisk ride.',\n",
       " '\"Help yourself,\" said Gilbert, not a little ashamed of the protest in Uncle Henry\\'s voice.',\n",
       " '\"Her!\" repeated Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Here they come!\" cried Angela, leaning out the doorway.',\n",
       " '\"Here\\'s your daddy, Pancho!\" she cried, when the car swung from the road, and Gilbert, hatless and sun-burned, leaped from the machine with all the eagerness of a great healthy boy.',\n",
       " '\"Here, sit ye down, \\'Red,\\'\" Mrs. Quinn ordered. \"But first see that yer feet is wiped off. I don\\'t want to see no dirt along me clean floor.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hey! Wait a minute.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hey! What the Sam Hill!\" and backed away; but not until he had dipped his hands into the bag.',\n",
       " '\"Hey! You can\\'t do that!\" wailed the invalid. He wheeled his chair toward his nephew. \"You wouldn\\'t do that if my friend Lopez was here, you big bum!\" he ended, as peevish as an infant.',\n",
       " '\"Hey, what\\'s comin\\' off?\" Had the darkness deceived him?',\n",
       " '\"His move!\" \"Red\" repeated the phrase. \"Say, you wouldn\\'t go and skin him out of the place all over again, would you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Hold on, there! You can\\'t do this.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hold up your hands!\" yelled the bandit, stepping over the threshold. And Pell\\'s hands went up, like magic, the spurs jangling to the floor.',\n",
       " '\"Hooray!\" the old man yelled, and would have risen in his chair could he have done so.',\n",
       " '\"Hooray!\" yelled Uncle Henry. \"That\\'s the boy! I knew you was like that. You\\'re all right!\" And he backed into the alcove, happier than he had been in a long time.',\n",
       " '\"Horses don\\'t know who they really belong to. So they are branded. There is no reason why women equally ignorant shouldn\\'t be similarly treated.\" Every word was measured, uttered with fearful distinctness. His hand shot behind him on the table, where \"Red\" had left his spurs. Lucia saw the swift movement.',\n",
       " '\"How are you, Smith?\" he said. \"Evenin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"How are you?\" the latter answered, with no show of interest.',\n",
       " '\"How can I, you--you--\" Gilbert could scarcely stand it any longer.',\n",
       " '\"How can anybody be nice about a thing like this?\" said the man of iron.',\n",
       " '\"How can he try any funny business?\" Gilbert asked.',\n",
       " '\"How dare you push my face, you bad man!\"',\n",
       " '\"How dare you! How dare you, I say! This is the crowning interference!\" He had put his hands behind his back and braced his shoulders, fearing that he would not be responsibile for what he did.',\n",
       " '\"How did you know?\" Jones asked.',\n",
       " '\"How do you know that?\"',\n",
       " '\"How much?\" Lopez asked, not noticing.',\n",
       " '\"How much?\" Uncle Henry asked.',\n",
       " '\"How would you like a little trip out West? You look peaked. Maybe it would set you up.\"',\n",
       " '\"How--long has he been here?\" Lucia wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"However, if you don\\'t think that offer fair, I\\'ll give you twenty thousand cash and assume the mortgages.\"',\n",
       " '\"Humph! An\\' what does ze \\'usband promise? An\\' \\'as \\'e kept \\'is promise?\" There was no reply. \"Is plain \\'e \\'as not. Zen why should you keep your word to \\'im, when \\'e \\'as broken \\'is word to you? Eh? Why do you not go before ze judge and \\'ave your promise broken? Why ees it ze custom of your country? Why? Why?\" He looked bewildered.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave kill many American citizens,\" replied Lopez, without the slightest compunction.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave know so for a long time.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave known ladies what are beaten. It is in ze eyes ... as in dogs and \\'orses.\" He waited a second before he went on, came close to her, and peered earnestly into her eyes. \"Si, I sink your \\'usband a evil man.\" He turned on Pell again. \"Say, who are you? Your business, I mean?\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave met mans which would not fight for zeir money,\" he said with great deliberation, his lip curled. \"I \\'ave met mans which would not fight for zeir lives. But I \\'ave never before met ze man which would not fight for \\'is woman.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave planty money. You mus\\' not worry, my frand. I give you ten sousand dollar which you can send back should you be so foolish.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave,\" the bandit answered. \"You need not thank me. It was a great pleasure.\" Evidently he smiled; Lucia would not look up.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave. Most enjoyishly!\" said Lopez, lighting a cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t got any. You robbed me of it!\" the old man flamed back. \"Now I\\'ll mind yours for a change. Make a monkey out o\\' me, will you, gol darn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t neither!\" Smith replied, like a little boy.',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t!\"',\n",
       " '\"I am married,\" was the answer.',\n",
       " '\"I am no damn fool!\" the bandit cried. And he deliberately raised his gun again.',\n",
       " '\"I am not going to force you to marry \\'im. You are going to choose to marry \\'im.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am not!\" he denied. \"I\\'m a business man.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am sorry. Zere is no oil,\" the bandit informed him.',\n",
       " '\"I am--nearly,\" she laughed. \"I\\'m twenty-four, you know.\"',\n",
       " '\"I asked \\'em!\" the invalid whined.',\n",
       " '\"I asked you,\" went on Pell, a little disconcerted at having to repeat his question, \"if you own this ranch.\"',\n",
       " '\"I bid one hundred thousand dollars,\" Pell quickly cried.',\n",
       " '\"I can take care of her,\" Gilbert was quick in saying.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t do it,\" Gilbert stated, as if he were discussing going to the nearest town.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t remember,\" the hollow voice went on. He fell back on the floor. He was weak from the loss of blood. \"Red\" lifted him up, and helped him around the table to a chair.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t stand such beauty, Morgan,\" she said at last. \"It takes something out of me. We\\'ll have to go on.\"',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t think,\" said Gilbert, sitting down, one hand on his forehead. \"It\\'s all so strange, so confusing to me. The world seems to be rocking beneath my feet. What does it all mean--this life we live for so brief a time? What does anything mean?\"',\n",
       " '\"I certainly do,\" cried Uncle Henry, \"an\\', gol darn it, I\\'m a-goin\\' to! Rob me of ten thousand dollars, will you?\"',\n",
       " '\"I did not know zat even a dog could be so yellow,\" he said. Then he turned to Pedro. \"I do not \\'unt rabbits. You kill \\'im, Pedro.\" And he would not look again on the miserable specimen of a man that wallowed there on the floor.',\n",
       " '\"I didn\\'t find it so,\" young Jones said, and smiled in his dry way.',\n",
       " '\"I didn\\'t--then. The time was inopportune.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not lend,\" was the hard response. \"I take.\" And he turned away.',\n",
       " '\"I do not see ze coffee,\" Pancho said at last.',\n",
       " '\"I do not speak about ze law,\" Lopez followed him up. \"I am doing only what is fair. If I were you, I should be ashamed for myself! You love your country?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do!\" answered Lopez, quick as a flash, and wondering how she could have asked so stupid a question.',\n",
       " '\"I do,\" she answered, \"and he\\'s right.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do--in a way. Oh, let\\'s don\\'t go into all that again, Morgan. We\\'ve had it out so many times. What\\'s the use?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do--in a way.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do?\" said Angela, wide-eyed.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t care if it\\'s only varnish!\" cried Uncle Henry, his voice rising high and shrill. \"And you let him go and take the whole bottle!\" He pounded the arm of his chair, always his last resort.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t dare to, Lucia.\" His voice was low.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t either!\" Angela protested, speaking before \"Red\" had a chance.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know exactly,\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know how he could!\" Uncle Henry cried, \"but he did! Look at him!\" He could scarcely control himself now.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what I am. But I do know I was only too glad to take the gamble with you. An\\' I\\'ll take another one right now if you\\'ve got one to suggest.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what to say, Gil.\" She moved closer to him. \"I\\'ve had a wonderful time--you know that. I want to thank you for it. You\\'ve been awfully kind to us.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what\\'s the matter. I haven\\'t thought much about eating.\" He was engrossed again in his papers.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know,\" the young man said. \"We\\'ve got to go somewhere.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know. I suppose--\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know. I--\" the foreman answered. Angela, frightened, followed the husky \"Red\" through the door; and the husband and wife were left entirely alone.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t mean to be ungrateful,\" Gilbert explained.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t mind business discussions. But there\\'s been too much insinuation to-day. I won\\'t have any more of it,\" Jones said.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t remember,\" was the disappointing answer.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t see how a woman as lovely as you can be so cold,\" he said. \"You could do anything with men.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want him to marry her,\" the father was honest enough to say.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want to be made happy at a cost so great,\" Gilbert affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want to kiss you.\" It was the refinement of cruelty. \"I want you to kiss me. Do it!\" His hands were behind his back. He stood straight and stiff as an Indian chief.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t wanter get shot,\" the old man declared.',\n",
       " '\"I get for you!\" the cook screamed in a shrill voice, and rushed for the kitchen.',\n",
       " '\"I get yer,\" said \"Red,\" visibly relieved.',\n",
       " '\"I got it!\" he all but yelled.',\n",
       " '\"I got them up especially, in honor of your visit,\" Jones said; and then he remembered how many times a remark like that must have been made, by many a lover, as if it were quite original, as if no one had ever thought of it before!',\n",
       " '\"I gotter stick by him,\" he said, looking at Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"I guess there\\'s no doubt about that. But it ought to be a guardian in my case; or maybe a keeper.\" She could see that he was stalling for time, and trying to laugh off a topic that was serious indeed to him.',\n",
       " '\"I guess they don\\'t grow any more. At least, not in this part of the country.\" He rose, a bit wearily, and walked over to the mantel-piece.',\n",
       " '\"I have so decide!\" the bandit stated.',\n",
       " '\"I have ze scouts who watch,\" the bandit said. He turned to Gilbert again. \"Suppose I stop here and prove to you who sink you have trouble, zat really you have no trouble at all?\"',\n",
       " '\"I have?\"',\n",
       " '\"I have?\" she wailed, terrified to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"I hope it\\'ll be soon!\" cried out Uncle Henry. Then, to \"Red,\" \"Don\\'t you see he\\'s leading you up to the top o\\' that gol darn mountain?\"',\n",
       " '\"I hoped to pick a fortune off a tree somewhere, and come back and surprise you with it. I was going to buy an automobile--one of those low ones as long as a Pullman car--and fill it with roses, and come dashing up to your front door and take you for a ride through the hills. It was to be autumn. I had even that fixed,\" he laughed. \"Oh, I had everything thought out! And you were going to be so proud of me!... But I couldn\\'t find a fortune-tree anywhere....\" He looked away, embarrassed. He hadn\\'t meant to tell her this.',\n",
       " '\"I knew there was a ketch in it!\" Uncle Henry said, and rolled back in the shadows of the alcove.',\n",
       " '\"I know I could be,\" Angela informed him.',\n",
       " '\"I know darn well he should!\"',\n",
       " '\"I know how he got mine, gol darn it!\" Uncle Henry cried. Hardy glared at him, seemed to smite him with his eyes.',\n",
       " '\"I know it,\" said Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"I know, I know!\" he cried. \"But once she gets her mind set on a thing--\"',\n",
       " '\"I know,\" said \"Red.\" Gilbert looked at him closely. \"I get yuh,\" the foreman continued. \"But I don\\'t like it just the same.\" He switched over to the malignant Pell. \"There\\'s one little detail I\\'d like to call your attention to,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"I know--I know,\" he said, and there was a shade of anguish in his voice. \"Forgive me. There shall be absolutely nothing said. Not even a gesture. I promise you that. It is as though we had never known each other.\"',\n",
       " '\"I missed you,\" Lucia answered, unashamed.',\n",
       " '\"I must make my frand \\'appy,\" the bandit said. Pedro gave the money to Uncle Henry. The latter grabbed it as a child might have grabbed a cooky.',\n",
       " '\"I never heard anybody complain,\" Gilbert smiled. \"After two or three of \\'em, I never saw anybody able to complain!\"',\n",
       " '\"I never knew life was like that!\" she said.',\n",
       " '\"I never thought I could love anybody so much!\" the girl replied. \"Oh, \\'Red\\'!\" And she hugged him again.',\n",
       " '\"I only hope he tells one!\" Uncle Henry couldn\\'t help saying, pointing to Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"I only want you to be nice about it, daddy,\" Angela persisted, sweetly.',\n",
       " '\"I pick from my men ze best rider. I make \\'im for look like me. So when ze ranger wish for chase me, \\'e go while I remain be\\'ind. It save me moch hexercise. Say, why you no kill \\'im yourself? You got ze gun.\" Lopez was mystified.',\n",
       " '\"I regret that I must insist,\" Gilbert said. And there was a duel of eyes, as well as of wits, before Jones turned away, easily the victor. After all, it was his own house, his own ranch. His visitor was wise enough to realize that. He walked over to the table and took the tequila bottle up again. \"I\\'ll have another drink, if you don\\'t mind,\" he said, to Gilbert\\'s back.',\n",
       " '\"I regret--that water--I gave away so liberally,\" Pell said, his voice weak.',\n",
       " '\"I remember, now,\" Pell murmured. \"The bandit.\"',\n",
       " '\"I rob ze bank,\" said Lopez; and thought nothing more of it.',\n",
       " '\"I say yes, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"I see what you mean! But I don\\'t agree,\" Pell pursued. \"This Jones person is nothing in my life. And why I should be deprived of my liquor and forced to eat burnt beans three times a day, I can\\'t see.\" He emitted a sound that might have been designated a laugh.',\n",
       " '\"I see,\" said Lopez. \"And wiz ze strange ideas of your country, it makes you feel bad.\"',\n",
       " '\"I seen him--I swear I seen him!\" Uncle Henry\\'s eyes were almost popping from his head. \"Why didn\\'t someone do something? Why didn\\'t they see what he saw? Oh, to be able to walk, and not sit forever like a dried mummy in this chair!',\n",
       " '\"I shall call you soon,\" Lopez said. \"Zen you shall see. Now go.\" He got between them, and affectionately directed them to the door.',\n",
       " '\"I shall give you ten sousand dollar,\" was the bandit\\'s surprising remark.',\n",
       " '\"I shall never understand ze American idea. I give you a gun, you say?\"',\n",
       " '\"I should enjoy it tremendous,\" Uncle Henry kept right on, and all but smacked his thin old lips.',\n",
       " '\"I should lend you ten sousand dollar?\" the bandit asked.',\n",
       " '\"I should think it would,\" Jones replied.',\n",
       " '\"I still have uncle,\" he reminded her.',\n",
       " '\"I swear to God!\" she contradicted him.',\n",
       " '\"I tell you one damn big lie,\" Lopez laughed. \"But \\'as she not a million dollar from ze \\'usband which I kill?\" He nodded toward Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"I think it\\'ll be ready soon, Uncle. Do be patient. I want to write.\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought I had done something to offend you,\" she said, standing very still, and looking far beyond him now, as though viewing their whole unhappy past. \"And it\\'s worried me even until this very day. I didn\\'t do anything to offend you, did I, Gil?\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought that was what husbands always did!\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought there might be--that\\'s all.\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought we were through with all that!\" he said. \"What\\'s the use of harping on it?\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought you loved it here?\" she said.',\n",
       " '\"I thought,\" Pell brought out reluctantly, \"I thought there might be--oil on it.\"',\n",
       " '\"I used to have; but it cost me too much money,\" was Hardy\\'s explanation and vindication. \"Sentiment? Bosh!\" And he made a gesture of deep disgust.',\n",
       " '\"I want his ranch, not him,\" Hardy went on. He might have been discussing someone not in the room.',\n",
       " '\"I want it,\" was the other\\'s immediate reply.',\n",
       " '\"I was afraid you wasn\\'t,\" ventured Uncle Henry; and there was an awkward pause. Then, \"It\\'s pretty hot,\" the invalid remarked, delighted that no one had called him to account for his obvious insult. He knew he had all the advantage of a weak woman. His little throne was immune from attack.',\n",
       " '\"I was broke, and I--\" he managed to explain.',\n",
       " '\"I was detained by force,\" Hardy said.',\n",
       " '\"I was eighteen when you went away. And that\\'s nearly six years ago. Time flies, doesn\\'t it?\" She smiled at her bromidic remark, and sat down; but he did not reply, \"Gil,\" she said at last. He looked up. \"Why didn\\'t you come to see me before I went away?\"',\n",
       " '\"I was going to,\" the other replied, not even casting a glance over his shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"I was in Washington,\" Pell winced. \"A dollar-a-year man.\"',\n",
       " '\"I was waiting for some good news to tell you. I felt you would consider me a failure--a rank failure. I couldn\\'t have stood that. Women don\\'t know how proud men are about that.\"',\n",
       " '\"I was,\" laughed the other. \"I mean--only a scalp wound.\" And he pointed to the mark on his forehead.',\n",
       " '\"I will make for you!\" cried the wretched cook, opening his eyes, and so relieved to be still alive that he could scarcely articulate.',\n",
       " '\"I will! I warn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"I will--if I must!\"',\n",
       " '\"I wish you wouldn\\'t do that.\"',\n",
       " '\"I won\\'t neither cut nothin\\' out! An\\' you make me sick too, you gol darn fool!\"',\n",
       " '\"I would look at you,\" the bandit replied. He was appraising her already. \"Turn around.\" She obeyed, like an automaton, \"\\'Ow old are you?\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'d like to remark,\" \"Red\" went on, \"that if we ever gets into the cow business again, we ought to get us a nice ranch in Washington, D.C. It don\\'t pay American citizens to go too fur away from home, these days.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll be cussed if I will!\" the invalid cried. He clapped his hands over his vest pocket, where the money was safely hidden.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll make it one hundred and one!\" Hardy cried.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll make you love me,\" he told her, with all the ardor he could put into his voice. Few women can withstand that age-old phrase.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll put him up in Bisbee till I get a chance to ship him back to Bangor. He likes Bangor, you know!\" Gilbert smiled.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll see about it now,\" Jones promised.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll take it to the courts,\" Hardy contended.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll try,\" said the accommodating \"Red.\" \"You\\'re a good friend, Mrs. Quinn. I won\\'t forget you when I own this place!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m a plain man, and I don\\'t believe in beating about the bush. Get that through your head--every one of you, I mean.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m a tough little feller myself, sometimes. And if anything should happen that shouldn\\'t, I\\'ll be waitin\\' for you in town with a one-way ticket. And it won\\'t be to New York. Savez?\" Then he turned to his adored and adoring Angela. \"Come, Angy!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m afraid you\\'re right,\" Gilbert said. \"I was afraid it would be inevitable. I couldn\\'t have hoped for anything else.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m an American citizen!\" shrilled Pell.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m damned if you do!\" cried Gilbert. \"All day you\\'ve been trying to make me do things your way. I\\'ve had enough. This Mexican stuff may be all right in your country, but it won\\'t go here!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m for that,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m giving up this ranch,\" he told her, \"I shan\\'t want them any more. Please take them, for my sake.\" He made a gesture, as though they were the last of his poor possessions.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m glad we happened to meet again. Though it does seem strange, doesn\\'t it, that we should run across each other after all these years!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to do what I once saw another sensible husband do under these circumstances.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to have this thing out,\" he said. \"You can never go back to him now.\" There was finality in his voice.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to tell them I\\'m going away--important business.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m in Wall Street,\" Pell said, in a low voice. What in God\\'s name was this bandit going to do? What was his game?',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m in bad,\" he told her. \"Got to give the old place up. But what\\'s that to you?\" There was a sound behind them. \"Here comes Uncle Henry!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not in business for my health,\" he said coldly.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not to blame because he\\'s a rotten business man, am I?\" Hardy tried to set himself right.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m so glad, Gil. But you haven\\'t answered my question yet.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry, I had a lot of things to attend to. I\\'m glad you\\'re back, for I was beginning to be worried about you, Lucia. Bandits! They\\'re around again.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" Gilbert returned. \"I forgot all about you for the moment. Oh,\" he suddenly remembered that Hardy and Pell were unacquainted, \"you two gentlemen ought to know each other. Mr. Pell, shake hands with Mr. Hardy.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" Jasper Hardy announced; but did not mean it.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said Gilbert, gallantly, going to her. \"Please don\\'t feel badly about it.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said his host.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" was all Gilbert could get out.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" was all Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry. What more can one say? If I--\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sure it is!\" the girl said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m terribly sorry,\" he apologized, \"to have to tell you that dinner will be late.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m--married.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ve got something to say,\" he announced like an oracle. \"Your daughter wants to marry him!\" He imagined this would prove a thunderbolt; but Hardy calmly asked:',\n",
       " '\"I--I couldn\\'t,\" Gilbert answered.',\n",
       " '\"I--I--\" the latter stammered; but could get no farther.',\n",
       " '\"I--er--yes. Why?\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"I?\" said Gilbert. He smiled a little, and looked significantly about the room.',\n",
       " '\"If I get this place, I\\'m willing to give him a good bonus,\" Hardy continued.',\n",
       " '\"If I was always nice to you, you wouldn\\'t know how lucky you are!\" she countered. \"It\\'s good for you to have your bad days--with me.\"',\n",
       " '\"If he pays me before eight o\\'clock,\" the other replied promptly.',\n",
       " '\"If she is all right by and bye, why the \\'ell is she all wrong now?\" cried Lopez, incensed.',\n",
       " '\"If that\\'s all, I\\'ll give her a divorce!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you do that,\" said the other, \"they\\'ll have to tie me down to keep me from kissing you!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you don\\'t look out, you\\'ll be dancin\\' soon!\" \"Red\" used to say on these happy occasions. \"You can shimmy now!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you want money,\" he finally got out, \"for heaven\\'s sake, tell me how much, and ...\"',\n",
       " '\"If you wish,\" Lopez said, indifferently. It mattered little to him now who waited upon him. His inner man had been partially satisfied. He leaned back in his chair, at peace with all the world. One spurred and booted foot was on the table.',\n",
       " '\"If you\\'ll excuse me?\"',\n",
       " '\"In Mexico you would now be married five years--\" the bandit explained.',\n",
       " '\"In a way.\"',\n",
       " '\"In one half hour your trouble go poof!\" He made a ring of smoke and watched it fade away. \"And you shall be \\'appy man. If I do zat, what zen?\"',\n",
       " '\"In the arroyo,\" \"Red\" replied. He was at the window, looking out. \"You\\'ll see \\'em in a minute.\"',\n",
       " '\"In the gallopin\\' wash-boiler?\" \"Red\" smiled, \"That still belongs to us--I mean, you.\" He clinked his spurs on the table.',\n",
       " '\"Indeed it does, Lucia. I\\'ve often watched that sky until I\\'ve forgotten all about my cattle--both of them!\" He laughed, and reached for the twine. He was always turning their serious moments into a jest. As long as she had been here with her husband, he kept at a distance.',\n",
       " '\"Inside, I think, lying down,\" Gilbert replied, nodding toward the alcove, his pen rushing across the page.',\n",
       " '\"Is there anyone else?\" he asked. \"If I thought there was....\" He lifted his glass again.',\n",
       " '\"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Lucia asked, sympathy in her tone. Always with her was the womanly instinct to serve, to help. Morgan was like a wounded animal to her, and as deserving of attention as any hurt thing.',\n",
       " '\"It ain\\'t a he--it\\'s a she, I told you!\" Angela corrected.',\n",
       " '\"It ain\\'t my fault, Angela,\" the foreman assured her. \"I didn\\'t know he was going to do this! You know that.\"',\n",
       " '\"It couldn\\'t be! It couldn\\'t be!\" Angela declared. \"Anyone so romantic as you, so--\" And she tried to look her pleasantest. He must be placated, this wretched man.',\n",
       " '\"It does,\" Gilbert explained. \"You see, it isn\\'t eight o\\'clock yet.\" A faint smile came to his lips.',\n",
       " '\"It is Gil\\'s, and to take advantage of him isn\\'t fair. You know it as well as I do, too!\" She stamped her little foot.',\n",
       " '\"It is a good deed,\" said Lopez, turning. \"He was evil man.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is for you to keep zat word as I keep mine,\" Lopez said. Then, to Uncle Henry he went on, \"I shall start wiz you. Now, Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is in her eyes--and yours,\" the Mexican stated. \"I shall miss her. She is very beautiful. However, what is one woman between frands?\" He laughed a bitter laugh. \"You shall have her.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is not what you want,\" a new tone came into Lopez\\'s voice. \"It is what I want. I am ze law, \\'ere!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is not zat we want money,\" the bandit replied. \"It is zat we don\\'t want you.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is quite to be seen zat you are,\" the bandit grinned. \"Zis, if I may speak so, \\'as been a lucky day for me!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is you! Don\\'t you know me?\" He faced him squarely, threw back his shoulders, and waited, breathless, for his look of recognition.',\n",
       " '\"It is ze ranger what chase me some more again,\" smiled Lopez. He seemed wholly unconcerned.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t ready yet,\" Gilbert informed him. Lucia took advantage of her husband\\'s question to move over toward the door.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t ready yet,\" Jones answered. He disliked the other\\'s tone. After all, he was a guest in his, Gilbert\\'s, house. He hoped their wretched business would soon be settled, and Pell return to New York. He had had his fill of him.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t what I wish,\" Jones answered. \"Nothing is what I wish.\"',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t zeir fault, too, is it?\" Lopez was curious to know.',\n",
       " '\"It makes me sick!\" was the unexpected reply.',\n",
       " '\"It shall be but a moment,\" the bandit promised. Gilbert walked to the fireplace so that his face would not be seen. Lopez went over to Lucia. \"Señora, you do not wish to speak of love. Why?\"',\n",
       " '\"It shall cost me planty money. I could \\'ave tooken you wiz me for ransom--\\'elluva big ransom--a million dollar, mebbe. But I am not soddid!\" He laughed, and rubbed his hands together.',\n",
       " '\"It was a trick?\" Gilbert asked, beginning to see light.',\n",
       " '\"It was only a flesh wound,\" \"Red\" said. \"The bullet just grazed his head.\"',\n",
       " '\"It was only pride?\" she was anxious to know again. \"Because you were poor! Gil! Did you think so little of me as that?\" There was a half-sob in her voice.',\n",
       " '\"It was paid me for a debt,\" the old man said.',\n",
       " '\"It was pride, I suppose,\" he went on.',\n",
       " '\"It was stolen from me first,\" Morgan Pell stated, calmly. \"Come across.\" He put one hand out. The other still held the cloth to his wounded forehead.',\n",
       " '\"It will?\" asked the incredulous \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"It would take too long to tell you.\" Hardy considered the argument closed; but Uncle Henry came right back again:',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s Pancho Lopez!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a Mexican drink.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a fair proposition, and, as far as I can see, your only way out, Jones.\" He had paid no attention to the old man\\'s interruption. But the latter broke in once more:',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s all right, Lucia,\" Gilbert said, and she went upstairs, almost weeping. Then he whirled about and glared at his uncle. \"It\\'s a good thing--no, I don\\'t know what I\\'m saying. You\\'re an invalid, or I\\'d strike you, despite your years, Uncle Henry. For heaven\\'s sake, can\\'t you learn to mind your own business?\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s all right,\" the foreman said. \"He ain\\'t got anything to lose anyhow. I\\'ll show you where he is,\" and, followed by the sinister Venustiano, he went out.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s always pretty hot till night--then it\\'s pretty cold,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s because they\\'re better looking than me,\" her slave went right on. \"I\\'m the one for you to marry, Angy, and you know it!\" He had faith in himself at last--she couldn\\'t stop him now.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s darn near night,\" Uncle Henry rasped.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s eight o\\'clock!\" \"Red\" exclaimed on the last peal of the bell.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s full o\\' dirt! Just dirt!\" Uncle Henry cried, and glanced about to see the effect of his surprising information.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s his--Gilbert Jones\\'s,\" cried \"Red,\" \"and I ain\\'t goin\\' to be party to robbin\\' him of it!\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s just that he doesn\\'t know any better,\" Angela went on to Gilbert. \"He\\'s really very neighborly when he wants to be.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s no use,\" Hardy broke in. \"You\\'re too late.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s only tequila,\" Gilbert tried to pacify him.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s poison!\" Pell cried. And as if he really believed it, and as though water were an antidote, he grabbed the water-bottle and drank from it swiftly and loudly. It was horrible the way he guzzled the liquid down. An animal would have done better.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s the law,\" Lucia told him.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s too horrible!\" said Lucia; and she turned away.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s too near the border,\" Jones answered. \"The bandits come over and steal all your cattle. It\\'s a rotten situation. I\\'m sorry I ever came down here.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s your life or his, and I\\'m damned if it\\'s yours! I\\'ll give you just three seconds to get out of here! Now,\" and there was a fire in his eyes that could deceive no one, \"you hear me? One--two ...\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s your reputation, of course,\" Pell smiled. \"You can do as you like with it.\" He turned fully toward her. \"All right, I\\'ve no objection.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s--it\\'s wrong!\"',\n",
       " '\"John Alden spoke for Miles Standish, an\\' they wasn\\'t even related,\" Uncle Henry tried to placate the other.',\n",
       " '\"Joking?\"',\n",
       " '\"Jones!\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"Just like her, eh?\" said \"Red.\" \"What would we do without Mrs. Quinn, the queen of \\'em all!\"',\n",
       " '\"Just to show the character of the ground, to see what will grow best,\" Pell hastened to explain.',\n",
       " '\"Keep still!\" he warned him, and shook his finger in his face, \"Keep still, I say!\" His cheeks were scarlet with rage. The blood pounded in his veins.',\n",
       " '\"Keep still!\" the girl cried. \"Keep still! I think you\\'re dreadful!\"',\n",
       " '\"Kill me?\" he repeated, his head on one side, like a bird listening, and pointing to his chest.',\n",
       " '\"Kiss me!\"',\n",
       " '\"Let her what?\" A pair of steely eyes were fixed on the questioner.',\n",
       " '\"Let him examine them, then,\" suggested Pell, holding the satchel out to Gilbert, who stood on the other side of the table.',\n",
       " '\"Life \\'as been unkind to you. Too long \\'ave you been marry wiz ze tired business man. You shall come wiz me to ze land of purple mountains, where I will love you myself personal.\"',\n",
       " '\"Life?\" Lopez smiled. \"To be \\'ere--zat is life. Not to be \\'ere--\" he gulped down some steaming coffee--\"zat is death. Life is a leetle thing--unless it is one\\'s own.\" He put the big cup down and put in four spoonfuls of sugar, stirred it diligently, and looked around him, the wonder of a child in his face.',\n",
       " '\"Like \\'ell! You love yourself!\" And Lopez deliberately turned his back on him.',\n",
       " '\"Like it? It makes me seeck! Even beautiful woman what I see \\'ave \\'osband what is afraid for \\'er. Each time I get dronk comes big policeman which \\'it me on ze \\'ead.\" He smiled at the thought, \"When I go to ze teatro, ees someone which \\'ide under--ze bed. Not even can I step on ze grass because--New York! It crush ze \\'eart!\" He put both hands over his chest, and looked up at the ceiling.',\n",
       " '\"Like ze tub!\" said Lopez, inexorably, spreading his arms to indicate an immense diameter.',\n",
       " '\"Listen, \\'Red,\\'\" said Jones, in sympathy with the lad, and hoping to cover up his confusion. \"If Hardy comes, keep him out till I\\'m alone. I don\\'t want any war talk before the Pells.\"',\n",
       " '\"Look at mine!\" the proud Lucia couldn\\'t help saying. \"Isn\\'t he the image of his father?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here, there must be some way to settle this thing.\" But he had grave fears.',\n",
       " '\"Look here, you\\'ve kept me waiting too long. What does this mean, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" Gilbert stepped in and said. \"You\\'re getting your money! What are you boiling about?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" he said, \"that\\'s my wife you\\'re talking to!\" Rage was in his face. He didn\\'t care whether he was this man\\'s prisoner or not. There should be no insults hurled at Lucia--that old, primitive feeling for his woman was roused.',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" he suggested, in a direct attack, \"can\\'t we settle things some way?\"',\n",
       " '\"Looks that way,\" the other replied. In their misfortune they were curiously united.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez! Lopez captured!\" There were tears in her eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez!\" Pell exclaimed.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez!\" exclaimed \"Red,\" forgetting his pipe, his dinner, and even Angela for the moment. \"The devil he has!\"',\n",
       " '\"Lucia.\" \"Lucia!\" he rolled the name over on his tongue, and smiled. \"Lucia!\" he repeated. \"Ees nice name.\" Then, \"Come \\'ere. Come \\'ere!\" He did not wait for her to move this time. He put out his hand and drew her close to him. \"I would see more of you,\" he told her. And, to her amazement and horror, he lifted her skirt delicately, almost tenderly. Her womanhood revolted at his action. This barbarian! She slapped his hand. But Lopez paid no more attention to the blow than if a child had struck him. \"Not bad,\" he went on, indifferently, referring to her well-turned ankle. \"\\'Ow you like to go wiz me to Mexico? Well?\" when she did not answer. \"You \\'eard what I said.\"',\n",
       " '\"Make a fool out of me, will you, you s----\" Pell said, and his eyes glittered. A snake never looked more venomous. \"I\\'ve got you now--got you both, and by God--\"',\n",
       " '\"Marry him. Won\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe Lopez didn\\'t kill him after all,\" \"Red\" said, and knelt down to examine Pell\\'s body again.',\n",
       " '\"Maybe it\\'s because he hasn\\'t a lot of money. He may be honest in that.\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe sometime. By and bye; but not now.\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe we don\\'t--and maybe we do, Gil.\" She went closer to him. \"Why don\\'t you marry?\" she dared to inquire.',\n",
       " '\"Maybe.\" She was teasing him, but he didn\\'t know it. \"Who were they?\"',\n",
       " '\"Me?\" said Lopez in surprise, \"It is not me, ees my double!\"',\n",
       " '\"Mexicans!\" he cried. \"What can they be doing here, now?\" His mind rushed back to that terrible evening so long ago when Lopez had ridden up to the adobe, and changed the world for them all in almost the twinkling of an eye.',\n",
       " '\"Millions!\" The word caught Uncle Henry\\'s fancy and imagination. He rolled it over on his tongue again and again. \"Millions!\" He babbled it, he played with it. \"Millions!\"',\n",
       " '\"Money, of course! That feller Pell, I mean. He\\'s rich, an\\' if he knowed that you and his wife was old friends--I betcher he\\'d lend you some.\" He paused, breathless, for he had run his sentences into one. Gilbert glared at him, as if he thought he had gone stark mad. But Uncle Henry was not afraid. \"You won\\'t ask him?\" he inquired.',\n",
       " '\"More than that. I want you to have them--to remind you--sometimes of--\" He broke off, like a frightened lad.',\n",
       " '\"Moved!\" cried \"Red.\" \"You\\'re crazy! He\\'s stone dead, if ever anyone was.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mrs. Quinn sent over the cake,\" Lucia announced, as the table-boy brought in a huge dish, on which was a chocolate cake of magnificent proportions. It looked--and was--as light as a feather; a work of art to be proud of.',\n",
       " '\"Much obliged,\" the ranger thanked him, nothing loath. \"Come on, Bloke. Good-night. We got him!\"',\n",
       " '\"My Gawd,\" the invalid fairly shrieked, \"all you gotter do is look at \\'em! I been watchin\\' \\'em ever since you came.\"',\n",
       " '\"My God!\" ejaculated Uncle Henry, furious at Angela\\'s accident, which so directly concerned himself, \"but everybody\\'s unreasonable to-day!\" He turned harshly on his nephew. \"You make me sick, you! Here am I doing my gol darndest to save the mess you\\'ve made, and you won\\'t even--\" He broke off, unable, in his wrath, to continue. His eye lit on Hardy. \"Look here,\" he cried, in desperation, \"ain\\'t there no way out of this thing? It was my money that bought this ranch, you know. And everybody knows it! The last ten thousand dollars I had in the world!\" There was a sob in his voice on the last words.',\n",
       " '\"My nevyer,\" the invalid said.',\n",
       " '\"My teeth!\" echoed Lucia. Did he take her for a horse?',\n",
       " '\"My! what a rotten life you \\'ave led!\" the bandit commiserated her. \"But ees not too late. I shall steel save you. But you shall not sank me. Shall not be so damn bad for me, too!\"',\n",
       " '\"Never no life? Never no fun? Ha! If you was old, fat--zen, perhaps. But young, beautiful! For why was you born if you no wish to leeve?\"',\n",
       " '\"Never! Never! Never!\" she screamed, and stamped her foot vigorously.',\n",
       " '\"Nevertheless,\" said Morgan Pell, \"I\\'ll just bid a hundred and seventy-five thousand.\"',\n",
       " '\"No grub yet?\" \"Red\" ventured. He was hungry even yet. Twenty-two is always hungry.',\n",
       " '\"No more than you loved any of the rest of \\'em,\" \"Red\" went on.',\n",
       " '\"No more\\'n a rattlesnake,\" Uncle Henry leaned out of his chair to whisper in a voice that could be heard by everyone.',\n",
       " '\"No wood alcohol?\" suspiciously. Pell was always looking out for himself.',\n",
       " '\"No! Don\\'t! I can\\'t--\"',\n",
       " '\"No! I am not cross wiz you! Eez zat you annoy me!\" And as though she were a doll, he pushed her from him, his big hand almost blotting out her pretty little face. The stool and Angela fell to the floor. She was furious. The devil in her was roused. Chagrined, she picked herself up. Her dainty plaid frock was covered with dust. She brushed it off as best she could, and cried:',\n",
       " '\"No!\" Angela contradicted.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" Lucia managed to say.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" came the gruff voice of Lopez. \"You!\" pointing to the frightened Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" she screamed, \"Oh, no, Morgan, not that!\" Her senses reeled. The earth crashed beneath her.',\n",
       " '\"No, I can\\'t,\" Uncle Henry was swift to deny. \"My smeller\\'s no good.\" He sniffed comically--as if that proved his point.',\n",
       " '\"No, I never can,\" Lucia agreed. And there was finality in her voice, too. It was as if Destiny had come into this house, and an unheard voice told them what to do.',\n",
       " '\"No, I wouldn\\'t!\" Uncle Henry protested. \"I--\" He quickly put his hand to his mouth, stopping it like a child caught in a lie. \"I mean--yes, I wouldn\\'t! Only we ain\\'t found the oil yet. And personally, I don\\'t believe there\\'s any here in the first place!\" Realizing what he had said, he caught himself again. \"I mean, it may be here, but--Don\\'t shoot yet! I\\'ll get it in a minute!\" he begged. He was agitated to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"No, Ooncle Hennery,\" the bandit laughed, \"she is yours for keeps. Zat is all. You may go!\" And he waved him out. \"And you,\" to Hardy. \"Pedro, show zem into ze open space!\"',\n",
       " '\"No, damn you!\" Pell in his rage cried out. \"But I\\'m going to, the first min--\"',\n",
       " '\"No, gratias; zat\\'s for peon. Zese from ze swell hotel National an Torreon--zay are good. I steal zem myself,\" pulling out his case and lighting another. He pushed his chair so that he could see young Jones better. \"Well, old frand, how you feel zis long time? Eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"No, not till eight o\\'clock,\" Gilbert\\'s passionless manner was maddening.',\n",
       " '\"No, sir,\" sitting up straight in his chair.',\n",
       " '\"No, thank you,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"No, thanks,\" Hardy said; but',\n",
       " '\"No, worse luck!\" Uncle Henry said.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" cried Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said Gilbert. \"This is something I\\'ve got to settle alone. But I thank you, \\'Red\\'--I thank you with all my heart. You\\'re a brick--a red brick.\" He smiled and patted him on the back.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said Lopez, definitely. \"For at \\'alf-past six-thirty, what I do? I tell you. When I am chase by ze ranger what I follow, I sink for myself eight o\\'clock she soon come. Suppose moggidge of my frands he meet wiz accident? Would never do!\" He waved his arms. \"So I goes and pays \\'er myself!\" He handed Gilbert a paper.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said his employer.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" she said. \"And I\\'ve always wanted to go.\"',\n",
       " '\"No,\" was the laconic reply.',\n",
       " '\"No--the gol darn fool!\" the old fellow screamed again.',\n",
       " '\"No. But ees more to be did zan I \\'ave sought. But I \\'ave promise I shall make you a \\'appy man, my frand,\" again to Gilbert. \"Bueno! I keep zat promise. You have gave me your word zat you will not interfere. Is it not so?\"',\n",
       " '\"No. I mean can\\'t--just what I said. It wouldn\\'t be fair to her. I can\\'t pretend to love her when I don\\'t.\"',\n",
       " '\"No. West,\" answered Jones. \"They\\'re going East.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\" Morgan Pell shot out the word, and clenched his fists. The situation was becoming hot. This old fellow would have them all dead in a few moments if he didn\\'t keep his mouth shut.',\n",
       " '\"No.\" The monosyllable was more emphatic than any long explanation could have been. A scowl on his brow, Hardy came close to Lopez, fearlessly. \"I came to foreclose a mortgage I hold on this place. That is all.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\" There was profound contempt in the little word. \"He give up \\'is business to go away to fight to save you, while you stay be\\'ind to rob \\'im. Is zat fair?\"',\n",
       " '\"No; I\\'d let you wheel yourself out,\" Jasper Hardy, again the literal-minded Hardy, said. It was one of the meanest remarks that even he had ever made.',\n",
       " '\"No; I\\'ll get it, thanks. You see if you can\\'t prod up the cook a little. I\\'m hungry now.\"',\n",
       " '\"No; only mussels. Good ones, too.\"',\n",
       " '\"No? You \\'ave been married all your life wiz one man?\"',\n",
       " '\"No?\" the bandit asked.',\n",
       " '\"None of your business!\" was the instant answer.',\n",
       " '\"Nor for anybody else\\'s,\" Uncle Henry, unabashed, told him.',\n",
       " '\"Not afraid of bandits?\" he laughed, sipping his champagne. \"It\\'s right next door to Mexico, you know. Have some swell times down there, they say.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not as rich as yourn, of course,\" Uncle Henry pursued; \"but rich for him--and he won\\'t do it.\" He waited for her to say something; but she did not speak. There was a pause. Lucia looked out at the baking valley, and off to the far mountains, and the ticking of the clock could be heard like steady rain in a cistern. Then she went over to the table near the alcove, where a few books were scattered about. She opened one, and pretended to read. All the time Uncle Henry\\'s eyes never left her. And she knew he was searching her thoughts.',\n",
       " '\"Not at all. Señor Jones \\'ave been away to war. He been away fighting for \\'is country.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not for a million dollars!\" Lopez smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Not if I got there by eight o\\'clock,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"Not like this.\" Lucia thought if he didn\\'t stop soon, she would shriek.',\n",
       " '\"Not me!\" Uncle Henry persisted. \"I\\'ve gotter tell the truth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not quite,\" said Gilbert. He stepped forward a pace or two. He saw that Lucia was alarmed. \"Come,\" he begged of her. \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Oh, the balm of those few words!',\n",
       " '\"Not really trouble.\" He came over and put his hand on Gilbert\\'s shoulder. \"Only trouble you are made for yourself because you go by law what are foolish instead of sense what are wise.\" He gave him an affectionate pat. Just then Uncle Henry wheeled himself in, neither inquiring nor caring if he was wanted or not.',\n",
       " '\"Not till after dinner,\" and puffed his cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"Nothin\\'. He\\'d better not. It\\'s the way he treats his wife. She\\'s so darn game, too. I wouldn\\'t treat a horse the way he treats her. Well, what are you goin\\' to tell them?\"',\n",
       " '\"Nothing of general interest.\"',\n",
       " '\"Nothing. You know how young people go on doing nothing. I\\'m just rolling up these rugs and blankets. I\\'m going to send them away.\"',\n",
       " '\"Now don\\'t tell me that!\" Uncle Henry yelled. \"Ain\\'t we got trouble enough here without him comin\\' back?\" He could have stood any calamity, it seemed, but the return to life of this wretched Morgan Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Now we shall visit,\" the bandit said, and put his arm through Gilbert\\'s. \"Ah! it ees so good to see you, my frand!\"',\n",
       " '\"Now you know me!\" Pancho went on. \"Ah! my frand! \\'Ow glad I am for to see you some more! Pedro! Venustiano! Ees my friend! Sabbe! Orders like my own! Serve \\'im as you would me!\" He went to Gilbert and frankly embraced him in the Latin fashion. \"Eet\\'s \\'ell of a good thing I reckernize you!\" he laughed, hugging his old friend close. He could never forget his kindness that night so many years ago; and to think he had run across his deliverer now!',\n",
       " '\"Now you know me?\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, Angela!\" said \"Red,\" his face the color of his flaming hair.',\n",
       " '\"Now, Angela--\" he said, and tried to grasp her arm. \"Remember, I\\'m here!\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, I\\'ve got you just where I want you!\" he snarled.',\n",
       " '\"Now, daddy--\" Angela began again.',\n",
       " '\"Now, father!\" she pleaded. She hated this business.',\n",
       " '\"Now, my frand \\'ere, \\'e wish to marry wiz you. Why, I do not know.\" Lopez grinned broadly. He knew this would be the last stroke. He was right.',\n",
       " '\"Now, wait a minute!\" Hardy begged. He could scarcely have this insult added to the host of others. \"I do love my country. I\\'m a good American.\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, zen, you all right some more, eh?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"Nozzing to get excite about!\" mimicked Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Of course I do.\" He got up, and walked over to the window. \"Your uncle don\\'t like jokin\\' much, does he? I asked him the other day why he didn\\'t get a chauffeur. Gosh! he got mad!\" \"Red\" laughed at the recollection.',\n",
       " '\"Of course I would!\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course it\\'s business,\" he replied. \"Precious little else I get.\" They were dining alone, at home, and he motioned the butler to refill his glass with champagne.',\n",
       " '\"Of course not. What are you talking about, you old fool?\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course, if you\\'re going to be nasty about it--\" Then, sweetly, to Gilbert she continued: \"Please don\\'t think too badly of us, Mr. Jones. Father doesn\\'t really mean any harm.\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course. What do you mean?\" She was at his side now.',\n",
       " '\"Of course. What of it?\" Gilbert was mystified.',\n",
       " '\"Oh! Oh!\" Sobs now came from her.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" Angela burst out, all confusion.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" The very thought made Angela ill.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" again came from the distracted Angela.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried Angela, when a full realization of what Uncle Henry meant came over her.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried Angela, who thought she had done so well.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried she. \"How can you speak of such things--now?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried the frightened girl now.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" gasped Angela.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" poor \"Red\" gasped, and leaped to his feet. \"Would you, Angela?\" He looked at her, drank her beauty in, as though she were the only creature on this earth.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" the anguished \"Red\" managed to get out. \"Is there, Angy?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" was all poor Angela could get out.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Gil--\" began Angela in tears.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" Gilbert said in desperation. What was the use in arguing with this barbarian? Yes, he was a barbarian--nothing else. They were miles apart. Centuries of belief and training separated them.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I see,\" cried Pell, wildly, and doing his best to keep his legs from giving way, \"you would kill me so that my wife can marry this Gilbert Jones?\" A sickly smile curled around his mouth.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'ll be through, all right--at eight o\\'clock to-night!\" Jasper Hardy announced, and drew several silver dollars out of his trousers pocket and rattled them about in his hand, significantly.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'ll get a job somewhere. Punch cows--or maybe join the rangers. There\\'s always something a fellow can do.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'m sorry! I ...\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Mr. Bandit!\" Angela put in once more.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Mr. Robber!\" Angela cried.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, before the war we agreed to try our fortune together down here,\" \"Red\" told her; and the little machine went whirring along. \"That\\'s the Hardy ranch,\" he said, pointing to the left. \"Nice folks.\" His eyes seemed to cling to the low house, and Lucia did not realize it at the time, but he slowed up the car. Presently a young girl came out on the stone terrace and waved to him. She was like a prairie flower. \"Red\" Giddings became another man in the twinkling of an eye. A flush mounted to his cheeks, and a smile as broad as a fat man\\'s belt all but encircled his countenance. He took one hand from the wheel and waved until they were out of sight down a curve in the road.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, but that isn\\'t so!\" Angela broke in, fearful that the mere mention of killing would bring about a murder then and there. \"I\\'m sure it isn\\'t!\" Nothing must be said to raise the thought in Pancho\\'s mind.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, cut that out, Uncle,\" Gilbert implored; but there was a little note of irritation in his voice. \"That\\'s no way to talk of a guest under our roof.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, do let me help you,\" she said. \"I\\'d like to.\" And she leaned down, knelt beside him, and held her white forefinger on the cord.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, do let me pour some more coffee for you!\" Angela begged.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, don\\'t joke, Gil! You need a woman--a wife--someone to mother you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, forget it! You don\\'t owe me nothin\\'!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, have you?\" Gilbert smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, ho! Leetle spitfire still!\" Pancho laughed. He chucked her under her pretty chin. \"So you marry ze man I pick for you, eh? Good! An\\' zis\"--pointing to the baby--\"zis ees better yet!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, how sweet you are, Pancho!\" she was saying. \"I don\\'t know what I ever did without you!\" And she kissed the baby\\'s cheek, which instantly took on a rosy hue.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, is that so?\" said Pell, beginning to see daylight. To young Jones he said: \"How far is it to town?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, it might have hit you!\" Angela cried and embraced him.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, it\\'s safe enough, I assure you. Would you like to try some of it?\" Gilbert suggested.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no! That would only make an issue of nothing. He doesn\\'t know anything? You\\'re sure? Oh, Lucia!\" He seemed suddenly overcome at their amazing meeting.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no!\" \"Red\" was quick to deny. \"I stand all right with him. He\\'s knowed me a long time. It\\'s her.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no,\" Jones said. \"We wanted a little Mexican touch in our households. And we\\'ve never forgotten you, old friend. Tell me, where have you been all these months? We hoped to hear from you. But never a word or a sign from you. Aren\\'t you just a little ashamed of yourself now, when you see how much we have been thinking of you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, nothing,\" Lucia Pell answered. \"You know how old people babble on sometimes about nothing.\" She turned and looked at him. Still the same handsome Gilbert! \"What are you doing?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, nothing--nothing at all.\" There was a nasal tone in his voice always--a twang that grated on sensitive ears. He turned on Gilbert. \"How about dinner?\" he asked, almost as though the young fellow were a hotel clerk.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so that\\'s it, is it? What\\'s the matter? Does her father object?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so that\\'s why you waved!\" disappointment in his tone.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so there ye be, me boy!\" was her motherly greeting. \"Come in, an\\' maybe--who knows?--I\\'ll find a cup o\\' coffee fer ye, though I\\'m not thinkin\\' ye deserve it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so there you are, my dear!\" was his cynical greeting.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, somethin\\'. It\\'s a secret.\" He turned and addressed Lucia Pell. \"Don\\'t forget,\" he admonished, and swiftly wheeled himself out into the yard again.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, sort of like gasoline with bichloride of mercury in it,\" Jones answered his eager questioner.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, thank you!\" Angela was all smiles. She was making headway with this evil man. \"Thank you so much,\" she followed up, and, standing sweetly at his left, she poured the brown stuff into his cup. \"Lovely weather, isn\\'t it?\" she remarked. The cook took the pot from her, and went back to the kitchen with it.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, these New York fellers!\" Hardy deprecated. \"You never can tell!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, two hundred dollars,\" Jasper Hardy grandly said.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, very well!\" Uncle Henry replied. He pushed his chair toward the door, murmuring as he went, \"Thank God I ain\\'t his wife! That\\'s all I got to say!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, will you, daddy--for my sake?\" Angela pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, you would--\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, you wouldn\\'t do that!\" said the kindly, honest \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, ze wolf in ze sheep\\'s overcoat!\" the bandit smirked.',\n",
       " '\"Oil not interests me,\" the bandit explained.',\n",
       " '\"Oil!\" he said. \"Then this ranch, instead of being worth nothing, would be worth hundreds of thousand of dollars--maybe millions!\" He had taken the bag from Pell\\'s extended hand, and now turned in dismay and confusion to the window, and put the bag on a chair. What a world it was, and how terrible that every other man seemed to be a predatory animal, ready to spring upon his neighbor and wrest anything he had away from him. What a world, indeed! No wonder young men lost their faith and courage!',\n",
       " '\"Oil?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"On the level?\" said Pell, eagerly.',\n",
       " '\"One promises to love, honor, and obey, in sickness and in health, till death shall part.\"',\n",
       " '\"Only a mere trifle of six months\\' wages,\" Gilbert laughed.',\n",
       " '\"Only a minute ago I heard you call him a gol darn fool!\" Hardy triumphantly reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"Only one guess!\" Lucia begged.',\n",
       " '\"Order a man around in his own house.\"',\n",
       " '\"Other plans!\" she cried.',\n",
       " '\"Out,\" was Pell\\'s curt reply; and he almost knocked Uncle Henry\\'s chair aside as he hurried into the yard.',\n",
       " '\"Packed up yet?\" he inquired, sarcastically, as though he meant to intimate that his coming journey would be a pleasant one.',\n",
       " '\"Pah! It\\'s too many damn rules in your army. For us who make revolution, no! We sleep so late we damn please. We fight some when we feel so. If we find ze hacienda, we take all what we choose. When we need money, we go to city and rob ze bank--we \\'elp for ourselves food from ze store, shoes, clothes, candy, ze cigarette, agauriante--\" he made as if to drink from an imaginary glass--\"booze! An\\' if anybody \\'ide anysing we cut \\'is fingers off so\\'s \\'e tell us. She is one fine life! You like for try? I make you general! Come!\"',\n",
       " '\"Pancho Lopez?\" Pell repeated, frightened almost to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"Pay me off?\" That would have been heaven! He could have taken Angela to the movies at Bisbee.',\n",
       " '\"Pedro,\" said Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Pells?\"',\n",
       " '\"Persuade him to what?\"',\n",
       " '\"Please don\\'t take me with you!\" Lucia appealed. Why had Morgan Pell ever brought her to this border line? She might have known better than to come. It was no place for a young and attractive woman.',\n",
       " '\"Please!\" Lucia pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"Pleased to meet you,\" answered Hardy, and turned away, \"Red\" and Angela, interested spectators of this foolish proceeding, sat together on the little settee by the window near the door, and smiled at the shillyshallying of two grown men who should have known better. Civilization! A mockery, surely, when two men couldn\\'t be amenable in the presence of others--two men who apparently had no reason for treating each other this way.',\n",
       " '\"Pleased to meet you,\" he said, and put out a white hand. \"How long you goin\\' to stay?\"',\n",
       " '\"Poco tiempo!\" the bandit said.',\n",
       " '\"Pronto,\" Lopez said. Then, to Lucia, \"Ze bread.\" She leaned over to get a piece for him. He watched her carefully. \"Your hand is shake. For why? You \\'fraid from me, perhaps?\"',\n",
       " '\"Pronto,\" ordered Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Proof?\" cried Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Protect her!\" Gilbert said, drawing Lucia closer to his heart.',\n",
       " '\"Protect yourself!\" repeated Gilbert, cynicism in his tone. He turned his back on them all and moved to the window. His very shoulders revealed the mental struggle he was going through.',\n",
       " '\"Put that down,\" said Hardy contemptuously. \"You might hurt somebody,\" he added, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"Put what over?\" Gilbert asked.',\n",
       " '\"Quite,\" answered Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Quite.\" And young Jones handed him the option on the property.',\n",
       " '\"Ransom!\" the former cried.',\n",
       " '\"Really? It doesn\\'t seem possible!\"',\n",
       " '\"Really?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" could stand this now: he had his Angela. And tucked in his big arm, he took her outdoors.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" did not understand. \"Gol darn what?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had been listening attentively. He came close to Gilbert now, and said, \"He wants the place. Didn\\'t he just say so?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had gone out of the room; but he came back now. \"Better get inside,\" he warned them all, definite fear in his voice. \"We\\'re in range. It\\'s pretty dangerous. As I said, accidents don\\'t happen down in this country.\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had gone over and looked out of the window. Twilight had definitely come, and the sky was a great sheet of flame. Orange, pink, purple, and red, the clouds shifted over the face of the dying sun. A king going down to his death could not have passed in greater glory. While men and women fought their little battles, waged their puny quarrels, this stately miracle occurred once more. Unmindful of the grief of mortals, the day was about to pass into the arms of the waiting night.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had not been able to dodge a shot. \"Right through the hat!\" he cried, and waved his Stetson. Sure enough, a bullet had gone clean through his headgear. Had he lifted his face a few inches higher, he would have been shot himself.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had put his head in one hand, and leaned back on the case, at peace with the world. His left foot beat a little tattoo on the side of the box. Now he sat up straight and looked sharply at Jones.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" intervened. \"Listen, Angela--\" he began.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" jumped at the question. \"What\\'s the matter?\" His nerves were on edge.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" loved the odors from this fragrant kitchen. The stove always gleamed, and when Mrs. Quinn was in good humor she was like a great light moving here and there, dispensing warmth also. She was a monstrous woman; but like many large people, she got about easily and swiftly. Her capable hands were forever fluttering in the flour-barrel or over the dough-board, and her ruddy cheeks and honest gray eyes spoke of health and good nature. She adored Angela; and she really liked \"Red\" tremendously, and hoped in the end he would win the difficult and fickle girl. But, like Angela, she had moment when she could have shaken him. For \"Red\" didn\\'t fight hard enough for what he wanted. He was naïve to the point of stupidity at times; and women like aggressive men--even men who are capable of flogging them into submission, deny it as they will. \"Red\" was gentle and mild, though thoroughly manly. Both Angela and Mrs. Quinn would have liked to see him live up to his fiery hair.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" nodded.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" rose slowly. His voice was almost a whisper. \"He\\'s alive!\" he breathed.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" sprang up. \"Rangers!\" he cried. \"They\\'re shooting!\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" stepped forward. \"Back, everybody!\" he ordered. He pushed everyone farther back into the room, until they were all crowded in one corner. Uncle Henry was trembling like a leaf. How he wished he had never been brought to this strange country! Oh, for the peace of Bangor, Maine! There was a place for you! Down here it was all shooting, killing, and desperate trouble. Having escaped one crisis, was it possible the fates were to be so unkind as to put him in the way of another, from which there might be no extrication? Curse the luck, anyhow. Gol darn it!',\n",
       " '\"Red\" turned and looked at his employer. He didn\\'t know whether he should ask the next question or not; but he took his courage in his hands.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" turned. \"Accidents don\\'t happen in Arizona--leastwise not with guns.\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" was certain they could not. \"There ain\\'t a chance, at that range,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" was distracted. \"Please come in, Angela,\" he begged. More shots were heard. He was frightened for everyone. He had lived too long down here not to know the meaning of such desperate shooting. \"What the h----\" Two bullets came through the window, and smashed a little mirror that hung on the wall near the staircase. The bits of glass fell to the floor with a loud crash.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" was suspicious still. He looked at Gilbert. \"You don\\'t think he\\'ll try any funny business, do you? You\\'re sure you won\\'t need me around?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\\'s trying to sober him up,\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\\'s\" face gleamed as if a lantern had been lighted behind it. He turned eagerly to Angela. \"Will I!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"Remember,\" his master commanded. \"Shoot ze first one which interrup\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"Right,\" Pell replied.',\n",
       " '\"Rob \\'im? Rob my frand?\" Lopez repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Robbed the bank?\" Gilbert was wide-eyed now.',\n",
       " '\"Santa Maria del Rio de Guadaloupe!\" he cried. \"\\'Ow many time I got for to kill you to-day, any\\'ow? Now, damn to \\'ell, mebbe you stay dead a while, eh?\" He looked down at the shriveled form. And as of old he called to his henchman, \"Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"Santa Maria--You come here.\"',\n",
       " '\"Say you will!\" \"Red\" pleaded, almost distracted.',\n",
       " '\"Say, I\\'m goin\\' to poke that bird in the beak some day!\" \"Red\" declared.',\n",
       " '\"Say, ain\\'t you got no heart at all?\" Uncle Henry wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Say, boy, you better use your head. You\\'re going to marry my darter, ain\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, five hundred dollars,\" the loan shark generously offered.',\n",
       " '\"Say, how about dinner?\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, where are you goin\\'?\" Hardy cried.',\n",
       " '\"Say, who the \\'ell is that?\" said Lopez, addressing himself to Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Say, you don\\'t think you love him again, do you?\" Hardy wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Say,\" Angela said, watching him, \"you seem to like that coffee a lot more than you like me! That brunette in the cup is my rival!\"',\n",
       " '\"Say,\" he wanted to know, \"who\\'s this woman, and what\\'s she busting into this for? We\\'ve had enough of petticoats around here for one day, it seems to me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Senile yourself!\" cried Uncle Henry, mad through and through, feeling he was immune from any attack. \"Gol darn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"Señor Wall Street,\" the bandit now addressed Pell, \"you \\'ave ten sousand dollar. I want it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Señors, señoras!\" he announced, in fascinating broken English, \"you are all my preesoner!\"',\n",
       " '\"Shall I bandage your wound for you?\" his dutiful wife asked.',\n",
       " '\"Shall he come wiz me to Mexico,\" the bandit piled it on, \"I will give \\'im planty wives, young, beautiful....\"',\n",
       " '\"She ain\\'t got no money,\" Uncle Henry informed the room.',\n",
       " '\"She gets it all--the wife,\" Hardy told Lopez. \"That is, if the husband hasn\\'t made a will.\"',\n",
       " '\"She told me she would.\" He got it out bravely.',\n",
       " '\"Shet your head!\" Uncle Henry cried; but not angrily--not now. He laughed when he said it, and was secretly flattered that anyone thought he had such pep at his age and in his condition of semi-invalidism (for that is all it could be called now).',\n",
       " '\"Shot through the shoulder,\" Gilbert answered promptly.',\n",
       " '\"Should I waste my time listening to sings which are not true?\"',\n",
       " '\"Should have been ready two hours ago. What\\'s the matter? Wish we had Mrs. Quinn over here.\"',\n",
       " '\"Shouldn\\'t you have asked that first--as a good business man?\"',\n",
       " '\"Show us where she is?\" Hardy asked, breathless.',\n",
       " '\"Shut up! How many times must I tell you to--\"',\n",
       " '\"Shut up!\" Lopez was genuinely infuriated now. \"Ees no use for talk wiz such fools. You make me seek! Such ideas! Not fit for ze child to \\'ave! No blood, no courage! Only ze liver what are white and ze soul what are yellow.\" Gilbert winced at the word. \"Americans! Bah! Fishes! Zat is all! Fishes what ees poor! Bah! For you I am finish!\" And he snapped his fingers again. His face was purple with rage.',\n",
       " '\"Si!\" laughed Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Si, Madre di Dios!\" cried the cook; and fled to his kitchen, tumbling over himself in his eagerness to get a meal for the bandit.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez answered.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez said. \"Sit down. Sit down.\" Angela thought of course he was speaking to her, and being kind to her because of her girlish attentions. So she promptly seated herself. \"No, not you!\" Pancho said roughly, putting six spoons of sugar in this second cup. \"You, I mean,\" indicating Lucia once more. Angela pouted, and turned her back on this bad, bad man. Pancho never even noticed her. The more opulent beauty of Lucia appealed to the sensuous in him. \"You,\" he repeated. \"Tell me, señora, \\'ave you never been to a free country?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez smiled. And Pedro got the invalid and the lanky Hardy through the door, as a woman might have swept two geese from her path.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered Alvarada; and after he had made certain that Pedro and Venustiano could handle the three men, one of whom, after all, was but an invalid in a wheel chair, he made his way to the kitchen. He knew there were two other companions who would help in any emergency. They slunk in the background, cigarettes between their lips, guns always ready for action. The house was completely surrounded.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered Lopez, calmly.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered the faithful minion of the bandit, stepping forward.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" remarked Lopez, evidently pleased at the sight. \"An\\' now, \\'ow much weigh?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" said Pedro again, and grinned broadly and pleasantly. If there was one thing he liked, it was the possibility of trouble with prisoners. He knew how to bring them to terms. He had been doing it for years.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" the faithful one answered, and came to his master.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" the latter said, meekly.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" was the quick answer.',\n",
       " '\"Si. Ah, my frand, I \\'ave make ze man from you at last! Fine man what would kill for \\'is woman!\" He patted him on the shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"Si. Is it so agree?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si. My frand\"--his hand went to Gilbert\\'s shoulder--\"ees great opportunity, ees revolution, for make speed. When I got well, I find I do not enjoy my work, which are \\'ard. Business? Business, she make me sick! I say for myself, \\'What to do?\\' Zen, suddenly I sink, \\'I shall be soldado!\\' Soldier which shall be giv ze \\'orse, ze gun, ze woman, and nozzing to do but shoot a little sometimes! Ees a wonderful life, my frand!\" The smoke of his cigarette curled to the ceiling.',\n",
       " '\"Si.\" He was unmoved by her apprehension. He walked to the very center of the room, and looked about him, studying all their faces.',\n",
       " '\"Si.\" Lopez had never used a politer tone.',\n",
       " '\"Simply that he\\'s been imbibing again. That\\'s why dinner is so late. But we\\'re getting used to it. There is nothing to do but stand it.\"',\n",
       " '\"So if we don\\'t get ten thousand dollars there by eight o\\'clock to-night, we\\'re set out on the bricks without no more home than a prairie dog--not as much!\" almost screamed Uncle Henry. \"An\\' yet you say why talk about it?\"',\n",
       " '\"So it seems!\" Morgan Pell answered, his lip curling. \"My dear, I regret to disappoint you. But aside from a slight pain in my head, I was never better in my whole life!\" He wanted to see the effect of his words.',\n",
       " '\"So there you are!\" he half sneered. \"Been riding?\"',\n",
       " '\"So you take ze rancho from my friend, Señor Jones. A nice sort of neighbor you are, you beeg fish!\"',\n",
       " '\"So zat, after \\'aving promise to love, honor, and hobey,\" he tapped off one finger at a time, and looked as if he wanted to get this mysterious matter straight in his mind, \"until death, you \\'ave ze right to break your word because ze judge say you can? Is zat it?\"',\n",
       " '\"So! You do love \\'im, after all!\" the bandit said to Angela.',\n",
       " '\"So!\" Lopez was interested, \"\\'Er \\'usband? \\'E \\'as money?\"',\n",
       " '\"So!\" her husband cried, significantly. Now she realized, in a blinding flash, the cruel subtlety behind his test of her. Her head went back; she closed her eyes. And then--how she did it she never knew--she raised her mouth.',\n",
       " '\"So!\" was all Lopez said, turning on Pell, and nodding his head. \"Ees nice wife--I like her. You do not mind, do you?\" His hand touched Lucia\\'s arm. \"Ees all right. I shall ask no question. You shall answer what I ask. And as is my custom, anybody what does not tell ze truth shall be quite suddenly--\" he paused just the portion of a second--\"shot.\"',\n",
       " '\"So, if you do not marry soon, it will be too late.\"',\n",
       " '\"So,\" she said. \"We\\'re back just where we started from!\" The grim humor of it came over her. Ten minutes ago she had thought her husband dead--done for, out of the way. Now he stood before her in all his virility, in all his cruelty; and behind him was the one man in the world that she loved.',\n",
       " '\"Sold ten head of cattle this morning, and Montrose says he\\'ll take as many more when I\\'m ready for him. Great, isn\\'t it? \\'Red\\' been over to-day?\"',\n",
       " '\"Some what? And who?\"',\n",
       " '\"Some women could have done it,\" he told her, sternly. \"But not you, my dear....\" Fury and sarcasm were in his tone. \"So! That\\'s it, is it? And I stand blindly by while you and he ...\"',\n",
       " '\"Sorry for you, lady,\" said Bradley, perfunctorily, as he might have said \"Good-morning.\" He turned now to go. \"Don\\'t touch him till the coroner comes,\" he commanded. \"Mind what I say.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sorry! Ees all you can say--sorry! Ze coward! Ze fool! Ze fish what are poor! Ze damn doormat for everybody to walk from!\" His arms were flying in the air. \"All day I \\'ave try to make ze man from you! It are no use. Ees no man in you. Only ze damn fool what are sorry! Bah! All right. You will not let me make you \\'appy? Bueno! Zen I shall go back and make you on\\'appy and serve you damn good right!\" He pointed to Lucia. \"You will not take \\'er?\"',\n",
       " '\"Splendidly!\" the young wife replied, glad that the atmosphere was cleared once more. \"Oh, Gil, it\\'s wonderful here--nothing but sky and the golden desert! What a miracle place!\"',\n",
       " '\"Sturgis telegraphed me that there was a big possibility of a new vein of oil down on the border,\" Pell was telling her. \"Some important men want to talk things over with me at Bisbee. I want to get started in a day or two. Don\\'t take your maid. It\\'s a rough country, but you\\'ll be all right. Just old clothes. You can ride a lot, so bring your habit. I\\'ll be busy most of the time; but I think you\\'ll like the trip. Never been down that way, have you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure I would!\" came from the wheel chair.',\n",
       " '\"Sure! All day I \\'ave want \\'er. Ees ze first time in my life when I want woman all day and not--as favor I give \\'er to you. Now, since you too big damn fool not to take \\'er yourself, I take \\'er myself. And what you know about \\'im?\" He paused, and called out, \"Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure! Ees what I go to town for.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure! In one half hour,\" the bandit was convinced.',\n",
       " '\"Sure!\" laughed Pancho.',\n",
       " '\"Sure, an\\' you\\'re welcome, me boy.\" Angela had gone out on the step. The old Irishwoman saw her chance. \"For the love o\\' Mike, \\'Red,\\' woo her, an\\' woo her hard! There is a feller in Bisbee. She\\'s after lovin\\' ye, but you\\'re too slow--slower\\'n the molasses I just poured on yer griddle-cakes fer ye!\"',\n",
       " '\"Surely we can play a part. It isn\\'t as if we were children,\" she said, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Take what to the courts?\" Pell wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Ten thousand dollars,\" came the quick response.',\n",
       " '\"Tequila? What\\'s that, Jones?\"',\n",
       " '\"Texas rangers after you?\" asked \"Red,\" startled.',\n",
       " '\"Texas?\" from Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Thank Gawd, I ain\\'t got nothin\\' to lie about!\" was Uncle Henry\\'s relieved thought, expressed aloud.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" Pell said; and he threw wide the door leading from the alcove so that his host might pass through. He waited for him to do so. Gilbert hesitated for the fraction of a second. He looked at Pell, and then at Lucia, still lovely for all her suffering. There was nothing to say--nothing he could say. He disappeared into the other room, and shut the door behind him. Pell immediately turned to the others. \"Well?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" said Gilbert. \"Do you mind putting your finger--there? Never mind. I think I can do it, after all.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" said Pell to Gilbert. Then, to his wife he said: \"And now that this is settled, we shall proceed to other business of even more importance. This gentle soul,\" looking at Uncle Henry, \"has said that our friend loves you and that you love him. Is it true?\" He was perfectly calm.',\n",
       " '\"Thanks,\" the ranger said. He went back to the door, and pushed the jug to the lips of his prisoner. \"Take a swig o\\' that.\" Lopez did so. His humiliation was evident even in his back. And only a little while ago he had been the monarch of all he surveyed! Now he was the slave of Bradley, and must ride, hand-cuffed, to the jail a few miles away.',\n",
       " '\"Thanks; much obliged,\" \"Red\" said, filling his pipe. \"But darn that cook, anyhow! If he wasn\\'t leavin\\', I\\'d fire him! As if you didn\\'t have enough troubles, without havin\\' to bother about late meals--an\\' guests in the house.\"',\n",
       " '\"That don\\'t prove nothin\\'. Mebbe he hasn\\'t found the oil yet. But it\\'s here! If it ain\\'t, why should you be fightin\\' so hard to get this rotten place? Tell me that, will you? Nobody else ever wanted it--except this kindly neighbor of ours!\" He glared at Hardy triumphantly.',\n",
       " '\"That is, if it ain\\'t too much,\" Hardy craftily added.',\n",
       " '\"That makes it all the better,\" Pell was shrewd enough to say. \"Then he\\'d lose his money quick, and be satisfied.\" And he laughed at what he thought a witticism.',\n",
       " '\"That was different. You\\'re married now. Oh, there is a vast change since then. I could not--Forgive me, my dear.\" He turned away his face. He did not want her to read what was in his eyes. \"Shall I send them, or would you rather take them with you?\" he asked, hiding behind that commonplace question the emotion he felt. His voice held a note of pain.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s all right. Keep it; you may need it later on,\" said Pell, as though the jug were his to give away.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s exactly what I do mean,\" Morgan Pell stated, firmly. \"And the sooner the better.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s one of my main reasons,\" Hardy cruelly announced; and the only come-back poor Uncle Henry had was an exasperated, \"Oh, is that so!\" drawled out peevishly, weakly.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s what I say,\" Uncle Henry declared. He could hardly wait to get to the cake, for he knew what toothsome dainties the Irishwoman could cause to emerge from her oven; and often she sent him this or that sweet, \"just to let \\'im know she was livin\\' an\\' breathin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s what I was hoping. So you\\'d like to go--really?\"',\n",
       " '\"The Bangor Daily Commercial, printed at Bangor, Maine. An\\' that\\'s the only decent town in the whole gol darn world. Wisht I was there now!\" He glanced at the alcove that led to another room, as if conscious that Morgan Pell might have heard him. He wanted to say something more to Gilbert, but something told him he had better keep silent. Instead, he read an item from the paper aloud to him. \"Listen to this, Gilbert,\" he said: \"\\'The Elite Fish Market has just received five barrels of soft clams from Eastport. Get there early, feller citizens! They won\\'t last long.\\' Think o\\' that, Gilbert? Clams!\" He smacked his lips, and even forgot how warm it was. \"Clams! An\\' I ain\\'t even seen one in five long years! Not even a clam!\" He turned his chair suddenly, and looked out of the open door, where the country meandered away. \"This is a hell of a hole! Why did we ever come down here?\" he whined. He swung about again, and faced his nephew. \"Say, Gil, do they have clams in France?\"',\n",
       " '\"The Mexicans like their liquor strong,\" young Jones explained. \"That\\'s what\\'s the matter with the cook.\"',\n",
       " '\"The bandit,\" Uncle Henry answered.',\n",
       " '\"The cook\\'s getting dinner now. Have a good canter, you say?\" young Jones inquired.',\n",
       " '\"The cook,\" he laughed. \"He is dronk!\" He now addressed him directly: \"You are dronk,\" he affirmed, and stamped his foot.',\n",
       " '\"The desert,\" Lucia answered.',\n",
       " '\"The finest in the world!\" Uncle Henry affirmed. \"Now, looky here, Mis\\' Pell: He won\\'t listen to me--funny the way folks are about their relatives. But I was thinkin\\' that mebbe if you was to ask him--\"',\n",
       " '\"The first million we make out of the oil that\\'s here!\" \"Uncle Henry proposed. And, serious as things were getting to be, a smile went around the group.',\n",
       " '\"The line forms on the left,\" the imperturbable Hardy said. \"You\\'re the fifth that\\'s had that hope this year. I don\\'t care a rap what you think, old feller! Remember that!\"',\n",
       " '\"The place?\" Gilbert repeated. \"What the devil does he want the place for?\"',\n",
       " '\"The poor stiffs!\" said Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"The rangers came,\" Hardy explained.',\n",
       " '\"The rugs I\\'m presenting to a friend of mine. The crockery goes to the cook. He has a family, you know.\" His irony was lost on the imperturbable Hardy, who merely asked:',\n",
       " '\"The sky, then!\" Lucia affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"The time\\'s up at eight o\\'clock,\" was all he said, and looked sternly at Gilbert, much as a judge who is pronouncing sentence looks at the prisoner at the bar.',\n",
       " '\"Them crockery, and the rugs?\" pointing to the articles significantly.',\n",
       " '\"Then I reckon I\\'ll have to foreclose,\" he went on relentlessly. \"There\\'s nothing else to do.\" His hands closed tightly, and his hard eyes looked even harder.',\n",
       " '\"Then I\\'d advise him not to buy here,\" said Gilbert, much to Pell\\'s amazement.',\n",
       " '\"Then I\\'ll make it a hundred and eighty!\" his antagonist stated.',\n",
       " '\"Then it wasn\\'t you they captured?\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"Then sit right down,\" Lucia said, \"There\\'s plenty--far more than the last time you were here!\" And they all laughed.',\n",
       " '\"Then that\\'s settled,\" Pell announced.',\n",
       " '\"Then we won\\'t see each other again?\"',\n",
       " '\"Then what\\'s the idea of this auction in the first place?\" Pell asked, mad through and through that they had been tricked by this Mexican fool.',\n",
       " '\"Then why are you giving it up?\" was the natural question.',\n",
       " '\"Then why don\\'t you, Gil? She\\'d make you very happy--a woman like that. I want you to understand.\"',\n",
       " '\"There could be only one name in all the world for that youngster,\" Gilbert said, and put his hand affectionately on his old friend\\'s shoulder. \"You ought to know it as well as I. Of course his name is--Pancho!\"',\n",
       " '\"There is oil here?\" Pell asked excitedly.',\n",
       " '\"There you are,\" said Gilbert, addressing his uncle. \"That\\'s what you get--\"',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s more,\" Gilbert cried. \"I\\'ll get it.\" He went hurriedly to the kitchen.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s no use your trying to tell me. Is that what you were going to say?\" His face showed his rage.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s nothing good in the place. But I think the cook has some tequila.\"',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s some down in the hay barn. Want me to get it for you?\" \"Red\" offered.',\n",
       " '\"They are ze best because each man makes them for \\'imself. Not like New York, where everybody tell you what you cannot do until zere is nozzing left what you want to do.\"',\n",
       " '\"They see him!\" cried \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"They should of shot \\'im in the stomach!\" Uncle Henry stated. What a mess! What rotten luck, ran through his weary brain.',\n",
       " '\"They tell me it\\'s God\\'s country, with big chances for everyone. I want to add to our little pile, Lucia,\" Pell went on. He hoped she would get the significance of the \"our.\"',\n",
       " '\"They\\'ll hang you!\" Gilbert warned.',\n",
       " '\"They\\'re not both fellers!\" Angela made bold to say. \"One\\'s a girl--that one! She\\'s mine!\"',\n",
       " '\"This court does. Somebody told the judge where he could get a bottle of liquor for eighteen dollars,\" Gilbert added, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"This is Pancho Lopez!\" \"Red\" Giddings said. Everyone\\'s hands were lifted, and pistols were held by the Mexicans, ready to go off at the slightest sign of rebellion.',\n",
       " '\"This ranch belongs to you, doesn\\'t it?\" he put the question direct to Jones.',\n",
       " '\"To Mexico!\" Uncle Henry said. \"This country\\'s gettin\\' so it ain\\'t fit to live in!\" And he whirled out of the room.',\n",
       " '\"To fight you?\" Pell looked him squarely in the eye. \"I do not. I\\'ve had all the fighting I want for one day. Now, my own course is simple. I have merely to go back to New York and forget that either of you ever existed. But your problem is more difficult. It\\'s after eight. You\\'ve lost the ranch. And you have no money.\"',\n",
       " '\"To marry her,\" Smith brazenly said.',\n",
       " '\"To marry you, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"To zat, I \\'ave come at last,\" the bandit replied with an emphasis that could not be mistaken.',\n",
       " '\"Told you we\\'d better keep inside!\" \"Red\" said.',\n",
       " '\"Too much!\" Lopez explained.',\n",
       " '\"Trick for what?\" the bandit wanted to know. He nodded to Pedro. \"Get ze men. \\'E will not shoot!\"',\n",

      "False  The old street, keeping its New England Sabbath afternoon so decently under its majestic elms, was as goodly an example of its sort as the late seventies of the century just gone could show. It lay along a north-and-south ridge, between a number of aged and unsmiling cottages, fronting on cinder sidewalks, and alternating irregularly with about as many larger homesteads that sat back in their well-shaded gardens with kindlier dignity and not so grim a self-assertion. Behind, on the west, these gardens dropped swiftly out of sight to a hidden brook, from the farther shore of which rose the great wooded hill whose shelter from the bitter northwest had invited the old Puritan founders to choose the spot for their farming village of one street, with a Byington and a Winslow for their first town officers. In front, eastward, the land declined gently for a half mile or so, covered, by modern prosperity, with a small, stanch town, and bordered by a pretty river winding among meadows of hay and grain. At the northern end, instead of this gentle decline, was a precipitous cliff side, close to whose brow a wooden bench, that ran half-way round a vast sidewalk tree, commanded a view of the valley embracing nearly three-quarters of the compass.\n",
      "False In civilian's dress, and with only his sea-bronzed face and the polished air of a pivot gun to tell that he was of the navy, Lieutenant Godfrey Winslow was slowly crossing the rural way with Ruth Byington at his side. He had the look of, say, twenty-eight, and she was some four years his junior. From her father's front gate they were passing toward the large grove garden of the young man's own home, on the side next the hill and the sunset. On the front porch, where the two had just left him, sat the war-crippled father of the girl, taking pride in the placidity of the face she once or twice turned to him in profile, and in the buoyancy of her movements and pose.\n",
      "False His fond, unspoken thought went after her, that she was hiding some care again,--her old, sweet trick, and her mother's before her.\n",
      "False He looked on to Godfrey. \"There's endurance,\" he thought again. \"You ought to have taken him long ago, my good girl, if you want him at all.\" And here his reflections faded into the unworded belief that she would have done so but for his, her own father's, being in the way.\n",
      "False The pair stopped and turned half about to enjoy the green-arched vista of the street, and Godfrey said, in a tone that left his companion no room to overlook its personal intent, \"How often, in my long absences, I see this spot!\"\n",
      "False \"You wouldn't dare confess you didn't,\" was her blithe reply.\n",
      "False \"Oh yes, I should. I've tried not to see it, many a time.\"\n",
      "False \"Why, Godfrey Winslow!\" she laughed. \"That was very wrong!\"\n",
      "False \"It was very useless,\" said the wanderer, \"for there was always the same one girl in the midst of the picture; and that's the sort a man can never shut out, you know. I don't try to shut it out any more, Ruth.\"\n",
      "False The girl spoke more softly. \"I wish I could know where Leonard is,\" she mused aloud.\n",
      "False \"Did you hear me, Ruth? I say I don't try any more, now.\"\n",
      "False \"Well, that's right! I wonder where that brother of mine is?\"\n",
      "False The baffled lover had to call up his patience. \"Well, that's right, too,\" he laughed; \"and I wonder where that brother of mine is? I wonder if they're together?\"\n",
      "False They moved on, but at the stately entrance of the Winslow garden they paused again. The girl gave her companion a look of distress, and the young man's brow darkened. \"Say it,\" he said. \"I see what it is.\"\n",
      "False \"You speak of Arthur\"--she began.\n",
      "False \"Well?\"\n",
      "False \"What did you make out of his sermon this morning?\"\n",
      "False \"Why, Ruth, I--What did you make out of it?\"\n",
      "False \"I made out that the poor boy is very, very unhappy.\"\n",
      "False \"Did you? Well, he is; and in a certain way I'm to blame for it.\"\n",
      "False The girl's smile was tender. \"Was there ever anything the matter with Arthur, and you didn't think you were in some way to blame for it?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, now, don't confuse me with Leonard. Anyhow, I'm to blame this time! Has Isabel told you anything, Ruth?\"\n",
      "False \"Yes, Isabel has told me!\"\n",
      "False \"Told you they are engaged?\"\n",
      "False \"Told me they are engaged!\"\n",
      "False \"Well,\" said the young man, \"Arthur told me last night; and I took an elder brother's liberty to tell him he had played Leonard a vile trick.\"\n",
      "False \"Godfrey!\"\n",
      "False \"That would make a much happier nature than Arthur's unhappy, wouldn't it?\"\n",
      "False Ruth was too much pained to reply, but she turned and called cheerily, \"Father, do you know where Leonard is?\"\n",
      "False The father gathered his voice and answered huskily, laying one hand upon his chest, and with the other gesturing up by the Winslow elm to the grove behind it.\n",
      "False She nodded. \"Yes!... With Arthur, you say?... Yes!... Thank you!... Yes!\" She passed with Godfrey through the wide gate.\n",
      "False \"That's like Leonard,\" said the lover. \"He'll tell Arthur he hasn't done a thing he hadn't a perfect right to do.\"\n",
      "False \"And Arthur has not, Godfrey. He has only been less chivalrous than we should have liked him to be. If he had been first in the field, and Leonard had come in and carried her off, you would have counted it a perfect mercy all round.\"\n",
      "False \"Ho-oh! it would have been! Leonard would have made her happy. Arthur never can, and she can never make him so. But what he has done is not all: look how he did it! Leonard was his beloved and best friend\"--\n",
      "False \"Except his brother Godfrey\"--\n",
      "False \"Except no one, Ruth, unless it's you. I'm neither persuasive nor kind, nor often with him. Proud of him I was, and never prouder than when I knew him to be furiously in love with her, while yet, for pure, sweet friendship's sake, he kept standing off, standing off.\"\n",
      "False \"I wish you might have seen it, Godfrey. It was so beautiful--and so pitiful!\"\n",
      "False \"It was manly,--gentlemanly; and that was enough. Then all at once he's taken aback! All control of himself gone, all self-suppression, all conscience\"--\n",
      "False \"The conscience has returned,\" said the girl.\n",
      "False \"Oh, not to guide him! Only to goad him! Fifty consciences can't honorably undo the mischief now!\"\n",
      "False \"Did I not write you that there was already, then, a coolness between her and Leonard?\"\n",
      "False \"Yes; but the whole bigness and littleness of Arthur's small, bad deed lies in the fact that, though he knew that coolness was but a momentary tiff, with Isabel in the wrong, he took advantage of it to push his suit in between and spoil as sweet a match as two hearts were ever making.\"\n",
      "False \"It was more than a tiff, Godfrey; it\"--\n",
      "False \"Not a bit more! not--a--bit!\"\n",
      "False \"Yes!--yes--it was a problem! a problem how to harmonize two fine natures keyed utterly unlike. Leonard saw that. That is why he moved so slowly.\"\n",
      "False \"Hmm!\" The lover stared away grimly. \"I know something about slowness. I suppose it's a virtue--sometimes.\"\n",
      "False \"I think so,\" said the girl, caressing a flower.\n",
      "False \"Ah, well!\" responded the other. \"She has chosen a nature now that--Oh me!... Ruth, I shall speak to her mother! I am the only one who can. I'll see Mrs. Morris some time this evening, and lay the whole thing out to her as we four see it who have known one another almost from the one cradle.\"\n",
      "False Ruth smiled sadly. \"You will fail. I think the matter will have to go on as it is going. And if it does, you must remember, Godfrey, we do not really know but they may work out the happiest union. At any rate, we must help them to try.\"\n",
      "False \"If they insist on trying, yes; and that will be the best for Leonard.\"\n",
      "False \"The very best. One thing we do know, Godfrey: Arthur will always be a passionate lover, and dear Isabel is as honest and loyal as the day is long.\"\n",
      "False \"The day is not long; this one is not--to me. It's most lamentably short, and to-morrow I must be gone again. I have something to say to you, Ruth, that\"--\n",
      "False The maiden gave him a look of sweet protest, which suddenly grew remote as she murmured, \"Isabel and her mother are coming out of their front door.\"\n",
      "True \n",
      "True  II\n",
      "True ISABEL\n",
      "False  There were two dwellings in the Winslow garden,--one as far across at the right of the Byington house as the other was at the left. The one on the right may have contained six or eight bedchambers; the other had but three. The larger stood withdrawn from the public way, a well-preserved and very attractive example of colonial architecture, refined to the point of delicacy in the grace and harmony of its details. Here dwelt Arthur Winslow, barely six weeks a clergyman, alone but for two or three domestics and the rare visits of Godfrey, his only living relation. The other and older house, in the garden's southern front corner, was a gray gambrel-roofed cottage, with its threshold at the edge of the sidewalk; and it was from this cottage that Isabel and her mother stepped, gratefully answering the affectionate wave of Ruth's hand,--Mrs. Morris with the dignity of her forty-odd years, and Isabel with a sudden eager fondness. The next moment the two couples were hidden from each other by the umbrageous garden and by the tall white fence, in which was repeated the architectural grace of the larger house.\n",
      "False Mother and daughter conversed quietly, but very busily, as they came along this enclosure; but presently they dropped their subject to bow cordially across to the father of Ruth, and when he endeavored to say something to them Mrs. Morris moved toward him. Isabel took a step or two more in the direction of the Winslow elm and its inviting bench, but then she also turned. She was of a moderate feminine stature and perfect outline, her step elastic, her mien self-contained, and her face so young that a certain mature tone in her mellow voice was often the cause of Ruth's fond laughter. As winsome, too, she was, as she was beautiful, and \"as pink as a rose,\" said the old-time soldier to himself, as he came down his short front walk, throwing half his glances forward to her, quite unaware that he was equally the object of her admiration.\n",
      "False Though white-haired and somewhat bent he was still slender and handsome, a most worthy figure against the background of the red brick house, whose weathered walls contrasted happily with the blossoming shrubs about their base, and with the green of lawn and trees.\n",
      "False \"Good-afternoon, Isabel. I was saying to your mother, I hope such days as this are some offset for the Southern weather and scenery you have had to give up.\"\n",
      "False \"You shouldn't tempt our Southern boastfulness, General,\" Isabel replied, with an air of meek chiding. She had a pretty way of skirmishing with men which always brought an apologetic laugh from her mother, but which the General had discovered she never used in a company of less than three.\n",
      "False \"Oh! ho, ho!\" laughed Mrs. Morris, who was just short, plump, and pretty enough to laugh to advantage. \"Why, General,\"--she sobered abruptly, and she was just pretty and plump and short enough to do this well, also,--\"my recovered health is offset enough for me.\"\n",
      "False \"For _us_, my dear,\" said the daughter. \"My mother's restored health is offset enough for us, General. Indeed, for me\"--addressing the distant view--\"there is no call for off-set; any landscape or climate is perfect that has such friends in it as--as this one has.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh! ho, ho!\" laughed the mother again. Nobody ever told the Morrises they had a delicious Southern accent, and their words are given here exactly as they thought they spoke them.\n",
      "False \"My dear,\" persisted Isabel, rebukingly, \"I mean such friends as Ruth Byington.\"\n",
      "False Mrs. Morris let go her little Southern laugh once more. \"Don't you believe her, General--don't you believe her. She means you every bit as much as she means Ruth. She means everybody on Bylow Hill.\"\n",
      "False \"I'm at the mercy of my interpreter,\" said Isabel. \"But I thought\"--her eyes went out upon the skyline again--\"I thought that men--that men--I thought that men--My dear, you've made me forget what I thought!\"\n",
      "False They laughed, all three. Isabel, with a playful sigh, clutched her mother's hand, and the pair drew off and moved away to the bench.\n",
      "False \"He puts you in good spirits,\" said the mother, breaking a silence.\n",
      "False \"Good spirits! He puts me in pure heartache. Oh, why did you tell him?\"\n",
      "False \"Tell him? My child! I have not told him!\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, mother, do you not see you've told him point-blank that it's all settled?\"\n",
      "False \"No, dearie, no! I only see that your distress is making you fanciful. But why should he not be told, Isabel?\"\n",
      "False \"I'm not ready! Oh, I'm not ready! It may suit him well enough to hear it, for he knows Leonard is too fine and great for me; but I'm not ready to tell him.\"\n",
      "False \"My darling, he knows you are good enough for any Leonard he can bring.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh yes, on the plane of the Ten Commandments.\" The girl smiled unhappily.\n",
      "False \"But precious, he loves Arthur deeply, and thinks the world of him.\"\n",
      "False \"Mother, what is it like, to love deeply?\"\n",
      "False The query was ignored. \"And the old gentleman is fond of you, sweetheart.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, he likes me. What a tame old invalid that word 'fond' has grown to be! You can be fond of two or three persons at once, nowadays. My soul! I wish I were fond of Arthur Winslow in the old mad way the word meant when it was young!\"\n",
      "False \"Pshaw, dearie! you'll be fond enough of him, once you're his. He's brilliant, upright, loving and lovable. You see, and say, he is so, and I know your fondness will grow with every day and every experience, happy or bitter.\"\n",
      "False \"Yes.... Yes, I could not endure not to give my love bountifully wherever it rightly belongs. But oh, I wish I had it ready to-day,--a fondness to match his!\"\n",
      "False \"Now, Isabel! Why, pet, thousands of happy and loving wives will tell you\"--\n",
      "False \"Oh, I know what they will tell me.\"\n",
      "False \"They'll not tell you they get along without love, dearie. But ten years from now, my daughter, not how fond you were when you first joined hands, but what you have\"--\n",
      "False \"Oh yes,--been to each other, done for each other, borne from each other, will be the true measure. Oh, of course it will; but there's so much in the right start!\"\n",
      "False \"Beyond doubt! Understand me, precious: if you have the least ground to fear\"--\n",
      "False \"Mother! mother! No! no! What! afraid I may love some one else? Never! never! Oh, without boasting, and knowing what I am as well as Leonard Byington knows\"--\n",
      "False \"Oh, pshaw! Leonard Byington!\"\n",
      "False \"He knows me, mother,--as if he lived at a higher window that looked down into my back yard.\" The speaker smiled.\n",
      "False \"Then he knows,\" exclaimed the mother, \"you're true gold!\"\n",
      "False \"Yes, but a light coin.\"\n",
      "False \"My pet! He knows you're the tenderest, gentlest dear he ever saw.\"\n",
      "False \"But neither brave nor strong.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, you not brave! you not strong! You're the lovingest, truest\"--\n",
      "False \"Only inclined to be a bit too hungry after sympathy, dear.\"\n",
      "False \"You never bid for it, love, never.\"\n",
      "False \"Well, no matter; I shall never love any one but myself too much. I think I shall some day love Arthur as I wish I could love him now. I never did really love Leonard,--I couldn't; I haven't the stature. That was my trouble, dearie: I hadn't the stature. I never shall have; and if it's he you are thinking of, you are wasting your dear, sweet care. But he's going to be our best and nearest friend, mother,--he and Ruth and Godfrey, together and alike. We've so agreed, Arthur and I. Oh, I'm not going to come in here and turn the sweet old nickname of this happy spot into a sneer.\"\n",
      "False \"Then why are you not happy, precious?\"\n",
      "False \"Happy? Why, my dear, I am happy!\"\n",
      "False \"With touches of heartache?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, with big wrenches of heartache! Why not? Were you never so?\"\n",
      "False \"I'm so right now, dearie. For after all is said\"--\n",
      "False \"And thought that can't be said\"--murmured Isabel.\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" replied the mother, \"after all is said and thought, I should rather give you to Arthur than to any other man I know. Leonard will have a shining career, but it will be in politics.\"\n",
      "False \"I tried to dissuade him,\" broke in the daughter, \"till I was ashamed.\"\n",
      "False \"In politics,\" continued Mrs. Morris,--\"and Northern politics, Isabel. Arthur's will be in the church!\"\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" said the other, but her whole attention was within the fence at their side, where a rough stile, made in boyhood days by the two brothers and Leonard, led over into the garden. She sprang up. \"Let's go, mother; he's coming!\"\n",
      "False \"Who, my child?\"\n",
      "False \"Both! Come, dear, come quickly! Oh, I don't know why we ever came out at all!\"\n",
      "False \"My dear, it was you proposed it, lest some one should come in!\"\n",
      "False The daughter had moved some steps down the road, but now turned again; for Ruth and Godfrey, returning, came out through the garden's high gateway. However, they were giving all their smiles to the greetings which the General sent them from his piazza.\n",
      "False \"Come over, mother!\" called Isabel, in a stifled voice. \"Cross to the hill path!\" But before they could reach it Arthur and Leonard came into full view on the stile. Isabel motioned her mother despairingly toward them, wheeled once more, and with a gay call for Ruth's notice hurried to meet her in the middle of the way.\n",
      "True \n",
      "True  III\n",
      "True ARTHUR AND LEONARD\n",
      "False  Godfrey passed over to the General, who had walked down to his gate on his way to the great elm. Out from behind the elm came the other two men, Arthur leading and talking briskly:--\n",
      "False \"The sooner the better, Leonard. Now while my work is new and taking shape--Ah! here's Mrs. Morris.\"\n",
      "False Both men were handsome. Arthur, not much older than Ruth, was of medium height, slender, restless, dark, and eager of glance and speech. Leonard was nearer the age of Godfrey; fairer than Arthur, of a quieter eye, tall, broad-shouldered, powerful, lithe, and almost tamely placid. Mrs. Morris met them with animation.\n",
      "False \"Have our churchwarden and our rector been having another of their long talks?\"\n",
      "False The joint reply was cut short by Godfrey's imperative hail: \"Leonard!\"\n",
      "False As Byington turned that way, Arthur said quietly to Mrs. Morris, \"He's promised to retain charge\"--and nodded toward Isabel. The nod meant Isabel's financial investments.\n",
      "False \"And mine?\" murmured the well-pleased lady.\n",
      "False \"Both.\"\n",
      "False The two gave heed again to Godfrey, who was loudly asking Leonard, \"Why didn't you tell us the news?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh,\" drawled Leonard smilingly, \"I knew father would.\"\n",
      "False \"I haven't talked with Godfrey since he came,\" said Mrs. Morris; and as she left Arthur she asked his brother: \"What news? Has the governor truly made him\"--\n",
      "False \"District attorney, yes,\" said Godfrey. \"Ruth, I think you might have told me.\"\n",
      "False \"Godfrey, I think you might have asked me,\" laughed the girl, drawing Isabel toward Arthur and Leonard, in order to leave Mrs. Morris to Godfrey.\n",
      "False Arthur moved to meet them, but Ruth engaged him with a question, and Isabel turned to Leonard, offering her felicitations with a sweetness that gave Arthur tearing pangs to overhear.\n",
      "False \"But when people speak to us of your high office,\" he could hear her saying, \"we will speak to them of your high fitness for it. And still, Leonard, you must let us offer you our congratulations, for it is a high office.\"\n",
      "False \"Thank you,\" replied Leonard: \"let me save the congratulations for the day I lay the office down. Do you, then, really think it high and honorable?\"\n",
      "False \"Ah,\" she rejoined, in a tone of reproach and defense that tortured Arthur, \"you know I honor the pursuit of the law.\"\n",
      "False Leonard showed a glimmer of drollery. \"Pursuit of the law, yes,\" he said; \"but the pursuit of the lawbreaker\"--\n",
      "False \"Even that,\" replied Isabel, \"has its frowning honors.\"\n",
      "False \"But I'm much afraid it seems to you,\" he said, \"a sort of blindman's buff played with a club. It often looks so to the pursued, they say.\"\n",
      "False Isabel gave her chin a little lift, and raised her tone for those behind her: \"We shall try not to be among the pursued, Ruth and Arthur and I.\"\n",
      "False The young lawyer's smile broadened. \"My mind is relieved,\" he said.\n",
      "False \"Relieved!\" exclaimed Isabel, with a rosy toss. \"Ruth, dear, here is your brother in distress lest Arthur or we should embarrass him in his new office by breaking the laws! Mr. Byington, you should not confess such anxieties, even if you are justified in them!\"\n",
      "False His response came with meditative slowness and with playful eyes: \"Whenever I am justified in having such anxieties, they shall go unconfessed.\"\n",
      "False \"That relieves _my_ fears,\" laughed Isabel, and caught a quick hint of trouble on Arthur's brow, though he too managed to laugh. Whereupon, half sighing, half singing, she twined an arm in one of Ruth's, swung round her, waved to the General as he took a seat on the elm-tree bench, and so, passing to Arthur, changed partners.\n",
      "False \"Let us go in,\" whispered Leonard to his sister, with a sudden pained look, and instantly resumed his genial air.\n",
      "False But the uneasy Arthur saw his moving lips and both changes of countenance. He saw also the look which Ruth threw toward Mrs. Morris, where that lady and Godfrey moved slowly in conversation,--he ever so sedate, she ever so sprightly. And he saw Isabel glance as anxiously in the same direction. But then her eyes came to his, and under her voice, though with a brow all sunshine, she said, \"Don't look so perplexed.\"\n",
      "False \"Perplexed!\" he gasped. \"Isabel, you're giving me anguish!\"\n",
      "False She gleamed an injured amazement, but promptly threw it off, and when she turned to see if Leonard or Ruth had observed it they were moving to meet Godfrey. Mrs. Morris was joining the General under the elm.\n",
      "False \"How have I given you pain, dear heart?\" asked Isabel, as she and Arthur took two or three slow steps apart from the rest, so turning her face that they should see its tender kindness.\n",
      "False \"Ah! don't ask me, my beloved!\" he warily exclaimed. \"It is all gone! Oh, the heavenly wonder to hear you, Isabel Morris, you--give me loving names! You might have answered me so differently; but your voice, your eyes, work miracles of healing, and I am whole again.\"\n",
      "False Isabel gave again the laugh whose blithe, final sigh was always its most winning note. Then, with tremendous gravity, she said, \"You are very indiscreet, dear, to let me know my power.\"\n",
      "False His face clouded an instant, as if the thought startled him with its truth and value. But when she added, with yet deeper seriousness of brow, \"That's no way to tame a shrew, my love,\" he laughed aloud, and peace came again with Isabel's smile.\n",
      "False Then--because a woman must always insist on seeing the wrong side of the goods--she murmured, \"Tell me, Arthur, what disturbed you.\"\n",
      "False \"Words, Isabel, mere words of yours, which I see now were meant in purest play. You told Leonard\"--\n",
      "False \"Leonard! What did I tell Leonard, dear?\"\n",
      "False \"You told him not to confess certain anxieties, even if they were justified.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, Arthur!\"\n",
      "False \"I see my folly, dearest. But Isabel, he ought not to have answered that the more they were justified, the more they should go unconfessed!\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, Arthur! the merest, idlest prattle! What meaning could you\"--\n",
      "False \"None, Isabel, none! Only, my good angel, I so ill deserve you that with every breath I draw I have a desperate fright of losing you, and a hideous resentment against whoever could so much as think to rob me of you.\"\n",
      "False \"Why, dear heart, don't you know that couldn't be done?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, I know it, you being what you are, even though I am only what I am. But, Isabel, you know he loves you. No human soul is strong enough to blow out the flame of the love you kindle, Isabel Morris, as one would blow out his bedroom candle and go to sleep at the stroke of a clock.\"\n",
      "False \"Arthur, I believe Leonard--and I do not say it in his praise--I believe Leonard can do that!\"\n",
      "False \"No, not so, not so! Leonard is strong, but the fire of a strong man's love, however smothered, burns on without mercy, my beautiful, and you cannot go in and out of that burning house as though it were not on fire.\"\n",
      "False \"And shall Leonard, then, not be our nearest and best friend, as we had planned?\"\n",
      "False \"He shall, Isabel. Ah yes; not one smallest part of your sweet friendship will I take from him, nor of his from you. For, Isabel, though he were as weak as I\"--\n",
      "False \"As weak as _I_, you should say, dear. You are not weak, Arthur, are you?\"\n",
      "False \"Weak as the bending grass, Isabel, under this load of love. But though he, I say, were as weak as I, you--ah, you!--are as wise as you are bewitching; and if I should speak to you from my most craven fear, I could find but one word of warning.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, you dear, blind flatterer! And what word would that be?\"\n",
      "False \"That you are most bewitching when you are wisest.\"\n",
      "False As Isabel softly laughed she cast a dreaming glance behind, and noticed that she and Arthur were quite hidden in the flowery undergrowth of the hill path. They kissed.\n",
      "False \"Beloved,\" said her worshipper, with a clouded smile, as he let her down from her tiptoes, \"do you know you took that as though you were thinking of something else?\"\n",
      "False \"Did I? Oh, I didn't mean to.\"\n",
      "False Such a reply only darkened the cloud. \"Of whom were you thinking, Isabel?\"\n",
      "False She blushed. \"I was think--thinking--why, I was--I--I was think--thinking\"--she went redder and redder as he went pale--\"thinking of everybody on Bylow Hill. Why--why, dear heart, don't you see? When you\"--\n",
      "False \"Oh, enough, enough, my angel! I take the question back!\"\n",
      "False \"You _made_ me think of everybody, Arthur, you were so sudden. Just suppose I had done so to you!\" They both thought that worthy of a good laugh. \"Next time, dear,\" added Isabel,--\"no, no, no, but--next time, you mustn't be so sudden. There's no need, you know,\"--she blushed again,--\"and I promise you I'll give my whole mind to it! Get me some of that hawthorn bloom yonder, and let's go back.\"\n",
      "True \n",
      "True  IV\n",
      "True AND BRING DOWN THE REMAINDER\n",
      "False  This \"hill path\" was a narrowed continuance of the street, that led gradually down along the hill's steep face to reach the town and the river meadows. Godfrey, halting before Ruth and her brother, watched the blooming hawthorn, over there, bend and shake and straighten and bend again, above Arthur's unseen hands. Then, glancing furtively back toward Mrs. Morris, he muttered to Ruth, while Leonard gravely looked out across the landscape, \"I live and learn.\"\n",
      "False \"So we learn to live,\" was Ruth's playful reply. To her it was painfully clear that Mrs. Morris, very sweetly no doubt, had eluded Godfrey's endeavors to inform her of anything not to his brother's unqualified praise. In the Bylow Hill group, Ruth had a way of smiling abstractedly, which was very dear to Godfrey even when it meant he had best say no more; and this smile had just said this to him when Isabel and Arthur came into view again. As the two and the three drifted toward each other, Ruth let Leonard outstep her, and joined Godfrey with a light in her face that quickened his pulse.\n",
      "False After a word or two of slight import she said, as they slowly walked, \"Godfrey.\"\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" eagerly responded the lover.\n",
      "False \"Down in the garden, awhile ago--did I--promise something?\"\n",
      "False \"You most certainly did!\" She had promised that if he would let a certain subject drop she would bring it up again, herself, before he must take his leave.\n",
      "False \"And must you go very soon, now?\" she asked.\n",
      "False \"I've only a few minutes left,\" said the lover, with a lover's license.\n",
      "False \"Well, I'm ready to speak. Of course, Godfrey, I know my heart.\"\n",
      "False The young man smiled ruefully. \"I've known mine till I'm dead tired of the acquaintance.\"\n",
      "False Other words passed, her eyes on the ground as they loitered, and after a pause she murmured:--\"But I've known my heart as long as you've known yours.\"\n",
      "False \"You've known--What do you--Oh, Ruth, look at me!\"\n",
      "False She looked, very tenderly, although she said, \"You forget we are observed.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, observed! Do you mean hope--for me--after all?\"\n",
      "False \"I mean that if you will only wait until we can get a clear light on this matter of Isabel's--which will most likely be by the next time you come\"--\n",
      "False \"Oh, Ruth, Ruth, my own Ruth at last!\"\n",
      "False \"Please don't speak so. I'm not engaging myself to you now.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh yes, you are! Yes, you are! Yes--you--are!\"\n",
      "False \"No--no--no--listen! Listen to me, Godfrey. I think that now, among us all, we shall manage Isabel's affair well enough, and that the very next time--you--come\"--She began absently to pick her steps.\n",
      "False \"What--what then?\"\n",
      "False \"Then you may ask me.\"\n",
      "False The response of the overjoyed lover was but one or two passionate words, and her sufficient reply, as they halted among their fellows, was to look across the valley with her meditative smile. Isabel took note, but kindly gave a long sigh of admiration, and with an exalted sweep of the hand drew the gaze of the five to the beauties of the scene below. The day was near its end. The long shadow of the great cliff behind Bylow Hill hung over the roofs of the town and over the hither meadows. The sun's rays were laying their last touches upon the winding river, and upon the grainfields that extended from its farther shore. In the upper blue rested a few peaceful clouds, changing from silver to pink, from pink to pearly gray, and on the skyline crouched in a purpling haze the round-backed mountains of another county.\n",
      "False To Mrs. Morris and the General the sight, from the old elm-tree seat, was even fairer than to the youthful group whose forms stood out against the sky, the floral colors of the girls' draperies heightened by the western light. For a while the two sitters gave the perfect scene the tribute of a perfect silence, and then the General asked, as he cautiously straightened his impaired frame, \"Has not Isabel been making some--eh--news for herself--and us?\"\n",
      "False The lady's lips parted for their peculiar laugh of embarrassment, but the questioner's smile was so serious that she forced her sweetest gravity. \"Why, General, according to our Southern ways,\" she said,--every word mellowed by her Southern way of saying it,--\"that's for Isabel to tell you.\"\n",
      "False \"Then why does she not do it, Mrs. Morris?\" asked the veteran, who had been district attorney himself once upon a time, and was clever with witnesses.\n",
      "False \"Why, really, General, Isabel hasn't had a cha--Oh! ho, ho! I oughtn't to have said that!\" Mrs. Morris had a killing dimple, but never used it.\n",
      "False \"I suppose--of course\"--said the General, \"she will say it's--eh--Arthur?\"\n",
      "False \"Now you're making me tell,\" she laughed, \"and I mustn't! General, Godfrey seems to be going.\"\n",
      "False In fact, Godfrey was shaking hands with Ruth and Leonard. Now he took the hands of Arthur and Isabel together, and Mrs. Morris laughed more sweetly and with more oh's and ho's than ever; for Isabel sedately kissed Arthur's brother.\n",
      "False Ruth made signs to her father, who answered them in kind. \"What does she say, Mrs. Morris? Can you hear?\"\n",
      "False \"She says they're singing 'your hymn' down in a church under the hill.\"\n",
      "False \"Ah yes.\" He beamed and nodded to Ruth; but when Mrs. Morris once more laughed, his brow clouded a trifle. \"Your daughter, Mrs. Morris\"--\n",
      "False The lady broke in with a note of bright surprise, rose, and took an unconscious step forward. The five young friends were advancing in a compact cluster, with measured pace. Ruth and Isabel, in front abreast, and making happy show of the hawthorn sprays, were just enough apart to conceal, except for their superior height, the three lovers, and in lowered tones, but with kindling eyes, the five, incited by Ruth, were singing the song they had caught up from the valley,--the old man's favorite from the days of his own song-time. The General got himself hurriedly to his feet; the shade passed from his brow. The group came close; he stepped out, and Isabel, meeting him, laid her two hands in his, while the halting cluster ceased their song suspensively on a line that pledged loves and friendships too ethereal to clash.\n",
      "False \"Isabel,\"--he turned up a broadened palm,--\"here's my amen to that line; where's yours?\"\n",
      "False With blushing alacrity she laid her hand on his.\n",
      "False \"Arthur!\" he called, and the lively lover added his to the two. \"Now, Ruth!\"\n",
      "False \"Father!\" laughed the daughter, \"isn't this rather youngish?\" But she laid her hand promptly upon Arthur's, and the lines of the General's face deepened playfully, and Mrs. Morris's dimple did the same, as Godfrey thrust his hand in upon Ruth's, unasked. The matron laughed very tenderly on the key of O while she added her hand, and received Leonard's heavy palm above it. Then Arthur clapped a second hand upon Leonard's, and Leonard was about to lay a second quietly upon Arthur's, when Isabel, rose-red from brow to throat, gayly broke the heap and embraced Ruth.\n",
      "False \"Well, honey-girlie,\" said Mrs. Morris, as she and Isabel reentered their cottage, \"wasn't it sweet of them all, that 'laying on of hands,' as Arthur called it?\"\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" replied the Southern girl, starting up the cramped old New England stairway to her room. \"It was child's play, but it was very sweet of them, and especially of the General.\"\n",
      "False The mother detained her fondly. \"And still, my child, you're not satisfied?\"\n",
      "False \"Ah, mother, are you blind, stone blind, or do you only hope I am?\"\n",
      "False \"My dearie!\"\n",
      "False \"Why, mother, excepting Leonard, we haven't had one word of true consent from one of them.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, now, Isabel! They'll all be glad enough by and by.\"\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" said the daughter, from the landing above, \"I've no doubt of that.\"\n",
      "False She passed into her room, closed the door, and standing in the middle of the floor, with her temples in her palms, said, \"O merciful God! Oh, Leonard Byington, if only that second hand of yours had hung back!\"\n",
      "True \n",
      "True  V\n",
      "True SKY AND POOL\n",
      "False  Arthur and Isabel were married in their own little church of All Angels, at the far end of the old street.\n",
      "False \"I cal'late,\" said a rustic member of his vestry, \"th' never was as pretty a weddin' so simple, nor as simple a weddin' so pretty!\"\n",
      "False Because he said it to Leonard Byington he ended with a manly laugh, for by the anxious glance of his spectacled daughter he knew he had slipped somewhere in his English. But when he heard Leonard and Ruth, in greeting the bride's mother, jointly repeat the sentiment as their own, he was, for a moment, nearly as happy as Mrs. Morris.\n",
      "False \"Such a pity Godfrey had to be away!\" said Mrs. Morris. It was the only pity she chose to emphasize.\n",
      "False Godfrey was on distant seas. The north-bound mid-afternoon express bore away the bridal pair for a week's absence.\n",
      "False \"Too short,\" said a friend or so whom Leonard fell in with as he came from the railway station, and Leonard admitted that Arthur was badly in need of rest.\n",
      "False At sunset Ruth came out of her gate and stood to welcome her brother's tardy return. Both brightly smiled; neither spoke.\n",
      "False When he gave her a letter with a foreign stamp her face lighted gratefully, but still without words she put it under her belt. Then they joined hands, and he asked, \"Where's father?\"\n",
      "False \"Inside on the lounge,\" she replied. Her lips fell into their faraway smile, to which she added this time a murmur as of reverie, and Leonard said almost as musingly, \"Come, take a short turn.\"\n",
      "False They moved on to the Winslow gate, and entered the garden by a path which brought them to a point midway between the old cottage and the larger house. There it crossed under an arch transecting an arbor that extended from a side door of the one dwelling to a like one of the other, and the brother and sister had just passed this embowered spot and were stepping down a winding descent by which the path sought the old mill-pond, when behind them they observed two women pass athwart their track by way of the arbor, and Ruth smiled and murmured again. The crossing pair were Mrs. Morris and Sarah Stebbens, the Winslows' life-long housekeeper, deeply immersed in arranging for Isabel to become lady of the larger house, while her mother, with a single young maidservant, was to remain mistress of the cottage.\n",
      "False The deep pond to whose edge Leonard and Ruth presently came was a narrow piece of clear water held in between Bylow Hill and the loftier cliff beyond by an old stone dam long unused. Rude ledges of sombre rock underlay its depths and lined and shelved its sides. Broad beeches and dark hemlocks overhung it. At every turn it mirrored back the slanting forms of the white and the yellow birch, or slept under green mantles of lily pads. It bore a haunted air even in the floweriest days of the year, when every bird of the wood thrilled it with his songs, and it gave to the entire region the gravest as well as richest note among all its harmonies. Down the whole way to it some one long gone had gardened with so wise a hand that later negligence had only made the wild loveliness of this inmost refuge more affluent and impassioned.\n",
      "False At one point, where the hemlocks hung farthest and lowest over the pool, and the foot sank deep in a velvet of green mosses, a solid ledge of dark rock shelved inward from the top of the bank and down through the flood to a depth cavernous and black. Here, brought from time to time by the Byington and Winslow playmates, lay a number of mossy stones rounded by primeval floods, some large enough for seats, some small; and here, where Ruth had last sat with Godfrey, she now came with her brother.\n",
      "False The habitual fewness of Leonard's words was a thing she prized beyond count. It made Mrs. Morris nervous, drained her mind's treasury, and sent her conversational powers borrowing and begging; Isabel it awed; Arthur it tantalized; to Godfrey it was an appetizing drollery; but to Ruth it was dearer and clearer than all spoken eloquence.\n",
      "False The same trait in her, only less marked, was as satisfying to him, and from one rare utterance to another their thoughts moved like consorted ships from light to light along a home coast. A motion, a glance, a gleam, a shade, told its tale, as across leagues of silence a shred of smoke may tell one dweller in the wilderness the way or want of another. Such converse may have been a mere phase of the New Englander's passion for economy, or only the survival of a primitive spiritual commerce which most of us have lost through the easier use of speech and print; but the sister took calm delight in it, and it bound the two to each other as though it were itself a sort of goodness or greatness.\n",
      "False \"They have it of their mother,\" the old General sometimes said to himself.\n",
      "False There were moments, too, when their intercourse was still more subtle, and now they sat without exchange of glance or gesture, silent as chess players, looking up the narrow water into a sunset exquisite in the delicacy of its silvery plumes, fleeces pink and dusk, and illimitable distances of palest green seen through fan-rays of white light shot down from one dark, unthreatening cloud.\n",
      "False \"Leonard,\" at length said the sister, as if she had studied every possibility on the board before touching the chosen piece, \"couldn't you go away for a time?\"\n",
      "False And with deliberate readiness the other gentle voice replied, \"I don't think I'd better.\"\n",
      "False While they spoke their gaze rested on the changing beauties of pool and sky, and after the brief inquiry and response it still remained, though the inner glow of their mutual love and worship deepened and warmed as did the colors of the heavens and of the glassing waters. The brother knew full well Ruth's poignant sense of his distresses; and to her his mute tongue and unbent head were a sister's convincement that he would endure them in a manner wholly faithful to every one of the loved hands that had lain under his the evening Godfrey had said good-by.\n",
      "True [Illustration: Indeed it was clear that to go away would be unfair.]\n",
      "False Indeed, it was clear that to go away--unless he honestly felt too weak to remain--would be unfair to almost every person, every interest, concerned; and such a step was but second choice in Ruth's mind, conditioned solely on any unreadiness he might have uprightly to bear the burden brought upon him by--well, after all, by his own too confident miscalculations in the game of hearts.\n",
      "False To him such flight signified the indeterminate continuance of his sister's maiden singleness and a like prolongation of her lover's galling suspense. To Ruth it stood not only for the loss of her brother, but for the narrowing of their father's already narrowed life,--a narrowing which might come to mean a shortening as well; and it meant also the leaving of Isabel and Arthur to their mistake and to their unskilfulness slowly and patiently to work out its cure. To go away were, for him, to consent to be the one unbroken string on a noble but difficult instrument. These thoughts and many more like them passed to and fro, out through the abstracted eyes of the one, across to the fading clouds, and back through the abstracted eyes and into the responding heart of the other.\n",
      "False At length the sister rose. \"I must go to father,\" she said.\n",
      "False The brother stood up. Their eyes exchanged a gentle gaze and tenderly contracted.\n",
      "False \"I will come presently,\" he replied, and was turning toward the water, when he paused, threw a hand toward the steep wood across the pool, and silently bade her listen.\n",
      "False The note he had remotely heard was rare on Bylow Hill since the town had come in below, and one of the errands which oftenest brought the hill's dwellers to this nook in solitary pairs was to hearken for that voice of unearthly rapture,--a rapture above all melancholy and beyond all mirth,--the call of the hermit thrush.\n",
      "False Now the waiting seemed in vain. The brother's hand sank, the sister turned, and soon he saw her pass from view among the boughs as she wound up the rambling path toward the three homes.\n",
      "False At the top she halted, still longing to hear at his side that marvellous wood-note, and was just starting on once more, when from the same quarter as before it came again, with new and fervent clearness. With noiseless foot she sprang back down the bendings of the path, having no other thought but to find her brother standing as she had left him, a rapt hearer of the heavenly strain.\n",
      "False She reached the spot, but found no hearkening or standing form. The young man's stalwart frame lay prone on the green bank, where he had thrown himself the moment she had left his sight, and his face was buried in the deep moss.\n",
      "False The stir of her swift coming reached his ear barely in time for him, as she choked down a cry that had all but escaped her, to turn upon his back, meet her glance, and drive the agony from his face with a languorous smile. The melting song pervaded the air, but neither of them lifted a noting finger.\n",
      "False Leonard rose to his feet. Ruth gave him a hand and then its fellow, and as he pressed them together she said, \"I wish you _would_ go away for a time.\"\n",
      "False He dropped one of her hands, and keeping the other, started slowly homeward; and it was not until they had climbed half the ascent that, with his most remote yet boyish smile, he replied, \"I don't think I'd better.\"\n",
      "True \n",
      "True  VI\n",
      "True IN THE PUBLIC EYE\n",
      "False  August, September, October, November,--so passed the year in gorgeous recession over Bylow Hill. Among their dismantled trees the three homes stood unveiled to the town on the meadows and to travellers who looked from train windows while crossing the river bridge. To those who inquired whose they were there was always some one more than ready to give names and details, and to tell how perfect a bond ever had been--how beautiful a fellowship was yet, now--up there.\n",
      "False Sevenfold they called it, although one of the seven was away; namely, Lieutenant Godfrey Winslow, of the navy, famed for his splendid behavior in the late so-and-so affair. That stately house at the right, they said, was his home what brief times the sea was not.\n",
      "False There lived, it would be added, his younger brother, so rapidly coming into note,--the eccentric but gifted rector of All Angels; whose great success in the heart of a Congregational community was due hardly more to his high talents than to the combined winsomeness and practical sympathies of his beautiful bride, or to the resourceful wisdom and zeal of his churchwarden, Leonard Byington.\n",
      "False \"Any relation to Byington, your new political leader in these parts?\"\n",
      "False \"Same man,\" the answer would be, and there the narrator was sure to fall into a glowing tribute to the ideal companionship existing between the rector, his bride, the young district attorney, and Ruth Byington.\n",
      "False What made this intimacy the more interesting was, in the eyes of a growing number of observers, that, as they said, \"Arthur Winslow was not always an affable man, and was much more rarely a happy one.\"\n",
      "False Behind and above this popular verdict was that of the old street behind and above the town,--a sort of revised version, a higher criticism. If the young rector, this old street explained, oftener looked anxious than complacent, so in their time, most likely, did St. Paul and St. Peter. If he was not always affable, why, neither are volcanoes; the man was all molten metal within. Anyhow, he filled his church to the doors.\n",
      "False Coaching parties of the vastly rich made the town their Sunday stopping place purely to hear him; not so much because the boldness of his speculations kept his bishop frightened as because he always fused those speculations on, white-hot, to the daily issues of private and public life, in a way to make pampered ladies hold their breath, and men of the world their brows. Such a man, to whom the least sin seemed black and bottomless, yet who appeared to know by experience the soul's every throe in the foulest crimes, was not going to show his joys on the surface in quips and smiles.\n",
      "False \"You should have heard,\" said the old street, \"his sermon to husbands and wives! His own bride turned pale. He turned pale himself.\"\n",
      "False It was wonder enough that even the bride could be happy, at such an altitude, so to speak; immersing herself utterly, as she did, in the interests that devoured him. All Angels forgot his gloom in the radiance of her charms,--the sweet genuineness of her formal pieties, the tender glow and universality of her sympathies, the witchery of her ever ready, never too ready playfulness. It was captivating to see how instantly and entirely she had fitted herself into a partnership so exacting; though it was pitiful to note, on second glance, how the tint and contour of her cheek were losing their perfection, and her eyes were showing those rapid alternations of languor and vivacity which story-tellers call a \"hunted look.\" Yet, oh, yes, she was happy; the pair were happy. It was as a pair that they were happiest. Else, said the old street, they could not keep up the old Winslow-Byington alliance so beautifully.\n",
      "False To the truth of this general outline the three homes' domestics, dominated by Sarah Stebbens, certified with cordial and loyal brevity. Yet when Ruth wrote Godfrey how well things were going, there lurked between her bright lines one or two irrepressible meanings that locked his jaws till they creaked.\n",
      "False In fact, both his brother and hers were \"ailing.\" Both carried a jaded, almost a broken look, and Arthur was taking things to make him eat and sleep; while Leonard had daily accepted more and more of the young rector's complicating cares, until he was really the parish's chief burden-bearer.\n",
      "False \"No,\" he said to his father, \"Arthur carries his whole work manfully on his own shoulders.\"\n",
      "False \"But, my son,\" replied the old General, \"don't you see you're carrying Arthur?\"\n",
      "False \"No, I sha'n't do that,\" dryly responded the son; but Ruth saw a change on his brow as on that of a guide who fears he has missed the path.\n",
      "False The four young friends spent many delightful evenings together in the Winslow house, with Mrs. Morris and the General on one side at cribbage. Ruth had frequent happy laughs, observing Isabel's gift for making Leonard talk. It gave her a new joy in both of them to have the lovely hostess draw him out, out, out, on every matter in the wide arena to which he so vitally belonged; eliciting a flow of speech so animated that only afterward did one notice how dumb as any tree on Bylow Hill he had been in regard to himself.\n",
      "False \"They are bow and violin,\" said Arthur to Ruth, with his dark, unsmiling face so free from resentment that she gratefully wondered at him, and was presently ashamed to find herself asking her own mind if he was growing too subtle for her.\n",
      "False On these occasions Isabel was wont to court Ruth's counsel concerning her wifely part in Arthur's work, thus often getting Leonard's as well. Sometimes she impeached his masculine view of things, in her old skirmishing way. Then she would turn rose-color once more and mirthfully sigh, while Ruth laughed and wished for Godfrey, and Mrs. Morris breathed soft ho-ho's from the cribbage board.\n",
      "False So came the Thanksgiving season, with strong, black ice on the mill pond, where the four skated hand in hand. Then the piling snows stopped the skating with a white Christmas, the old year sank to rest, the new rose up, and Bylow Hill, under its bare elms and with the pine-crested ridge at its back, sat in the cold sunshine like a white sea bird with its head in its down. And when the nights were frigid and clear its ruddy lights of lamp and hearth seemed to answer the downward gaze of the stars in silent gratitude for conditions of happiness strangely perfect for this imperfect world, and the town marvelled at the young rector's grasp of his subject when his text was, \"The heart knoweth his own bitterness.\"\n",

      "False  SIR,--I find myself compelled to ask that you consider your acquaintanceship with my wife at an end. Doubtless this request will give you more relief than surprise. The visible waste of your frame and the loss of her exquisite bloom are proof enough that both you and she have long been in daily dread of a far worse visitation. It is not worse, because I know how sentimental your impotent and conscience-plagued interchanges of affection have been. I shall permit and assist you to keep this matter a secret. To let it be known would instantly wreck your own career, and would blast at a breath the fortunes of our church and of every one of both our kindreds. I will therefore not at this time require you to resign your church office or to break off those business intimacies with me which, though no longer founded in personal esteem, are vital to interests that common decency must move you to shield from new peril.\n",
      "False  I ask for no repair of the inextinguishable wrong you have done me. I only ask you not to fancy that I am to be beguiled by arguments or denials or moved by threats, or that one word I here write is founded on conjecture or inference. Grovelling at my feet, in sobs of shame and with prayers for pardon, Isabel has told me all. Has told me all, Leonard Byington, my once trusted friend. Now, though prostrated on her bed, she rejoices in the double forgiveness of her husband and her priest, blessing him for deliverance from the misleadings of one who--great God! must I write it?--might at last have dragged her into crime. It is her request, as it is my command, that you darken our threshold no more, and that as far as practicable you keep yourself from her sight.\n",

      "False \"I'm all right,\" said the young man, freeing his hand and smiling with white lips. He took his hat and passed out.\n",
      "False Meanwhile Isabel lay on her bed too overwhelmed to rise. In his room adjoining, with doors locked, Arthur paced the floor. He had spent the first half of the night in an agonizing interview with his wife, and the second half in writing and rewriting the letter to Leonard.\n",
      "False Now Isabel noticed the cessation of his steps. In the door between them the key turned; then the door opened, and he stood, haggard and dishevelled, gazing on her. She sat up in the bed, wan, tear-spent, her glorious hair falling over the embroideries of her nightdress.\n",

      "False \"No, nor to let you, if I can prevent you. Arthur, you have allowed a base jealousy to persuade you, in the face of every contrary evidence, that your fair young wife has lost her loyalty--and your nearest friend the commonest honesty--in a clandestine love. Under the goadings of that passion you have foully guessed, have heartlessly accused, have brazenly lied. Isabel has confessed nothing to you, and I know by your lies to me how pusillanimously you must have been lying to her. Had your guess been right, I should not have known you were only guessing, and your successful iniquity would have remained hidden from everybody but yourself--I still do you the honor to believe you would have realized it. Now the vital question is, do you realize it, and will you undo it?\"\n",
      "False Arthur was deadly pale; his pointing finger trembled. \"Leave\"--he choked--\"leave this house.\"\n",
      "False Leonard turned scarlet, but his tone sank low. \"Arthur, I don't believe your soul is rotten. If I did, I should not be such a knave or such a fool as to make any treaty with you that would leave you in your pulpit one Sabbath Day.\"\n",

      "False \"Quite the contrary. To trust the fortunes of our loved ones to any treaty with a rotten soul would indeed be to launch them upon a stormy sea in a rotten boat. But I do not believe your soul is so. I believe it is sound,--still sound, though on fire; and so, to help you quench its burning, I give you my pledge to be from this day a stranger to your sweet wife. And now will you do something for me, to prove that your soul is sound and is going to stay sound? It shall be the least I can ask in good faith to the world we live in.\"\n",

      "False \"No. No, Arthur. Women are strange; every chance is that in her eyes I shall be abased.\" The speaker went whiter than ever.\n",

      "False Ruth gave him a look of tender approval, laid a hand in his, and bent into the evening fire her far-off smile. Thus, and only thus, he knew she had divined what had befallen.\n",
      "False A day or two afterward Mrs. Morris brought him a note from Arthur. He wrote an answer while she stayed, and while Ruth listened elatedly to her sprightly account of how well Isabel still bore the burden of nursing a most loving but most nervous husband.\n",
      "False The missive from Arthur was a short but complete and propitiative acknowledgment of his error and fraility. It offered no change in the agreement as to Isabel, but it professed a high yet humble resolve to fall no more, and it ended with a manly offer to resign his pulpit, and even to lay aside his sacred calling, if Leonard retained any belief in the moral necessity of his so doing.\n",
      "False Leonard's reply was a very brief exhortation to his friend to put away all thought of resigning, and to take up his work again with the zeal with which he had first entered upon it.\n",
      "False Mrs. Morris went away refreshed, and left the Byingtons equally so. Her buoyancy had been as prettily restrained, her sympathies as sweet, her dimple as unconscious, her belief in everybody's wit and wisdom except her own as genuine, and her timid dissimulations as kindly meant and as transparent, as ever. Yet there was an unspoken compassion for her when she was gone, for in the parting words with which she playfully vaunted her ignorance of the correspondence she was bearing, it was clear, even to the General, that behind that small ignorance she had a larger knowledge,--a fact that made her dainty cheerfulness seem very brave.\n",

      "False Leonard was back in his own town, enriched with new esteem from the public and from the men of his profession. The noted case was won, a victory for the peace and dignity of the state, due wholly, it was said, to the energy and sagacity of the young district attorney. A murder had been so cunningly done that suspicion could fasten nowhere, until Byington laid his finger upon a man of so unspotted a name that no one else had had the mental courage to point to him. Through a long and masterly untangling of contradictions the state's counsel had so overwhelmingly proved him guilty that he had confessed without waiting for the jury's verdict.\n",

One darkly guessed he was writing a book, and the vestryman who had praised the lovely simplicity of the wedding lucidly explained that the young rector had \"lost his grip.\"\n",

      "False True, but hardly the whole truth. In her mother's cottage her smiles were almost sad, and when she had crossed the garden and got into her own room she dropped upon her bed and wept. Yet she quickly ceased, and put on again a brave serenity, for a very tender reason which forbade such risks.\n",
      "False A bunch of the church's best men got together and agreed that all Arthur needed was rest; that this bright moment was the right one in which to offer him a vacation; that his physician should flatly order him to take it; and that Byington should arrange the matter.\n",

He went; and he had not been three hours gone when Isabel received a dispatch calling her to her mother. The only day train would leave in a few minutes, and she had the fortune to catch it.\n",

      "False Another day passed, another came, and Mrs. Morris was still in danger. Isabel wrote Arthur that she would be with him the moment the peril was over, if he needed her; but if he did not, she would stay on for her mother's fuller recovery. Her letter had barely gone when she received a pencilled line brought in to the mountain hotel by a chance messenger and sent on to her, saying he would be out on his tramp five days instead of three. On the fifth day she telegraphed that her mother was getting well so fast that she would come, now, at his word.\n",

      "False \"I didn't know father had received a letter from Godfrey,\" said Ruth, shading her face from the lamp, and lifting to Leonard a smile which implied that it would have been but fair for him to have told her.\n",
      "False \"It came the day before Arthur went away,\" replied Leonard, and Ruth reluctantly chose a new topic.\n",
      "False They rarely had an evening together thus, and with a soft rain falling at the open windows they sat and talked on many themes in what was to them a very talkative way. When something brought up the subject of the late noted trial, Ruth asked her brother how it had first come to him to suspect so unsuspected a man.\n",
      "False His reply was tardy. \"Partly,\" he said, and mused while he spoke, \"because I am so unsuspected a man myself.\"\n",
      "False He looked up with a smile, half play, half pain. \"I know what the mind of an unsuspected man is capable of--under pressure.\"\n",
      "False The questioner looked on him with fond faith, and then, dropping her eyes to her needlework, said, \"That wasn't all that prompted you, was it?\"\n",
      "False \"No,\" replied the brother, again musing. \"I had noticed the singular value of wanton guesswork.\"\n",
      "False \"I thought so,\" said the sister. Her needle flagged and stopped, and each knew the other's mind was on the implacable divinations of one morbid soul.\n",
      "False Leonard leaned and fingered the needlework,--a worsted slipper, too small for most men, too large for most women. \"Is that for him?\"\n",
      "False \"Yes,\" apologized Ruth; \"it's the thing every clergyman has to incur. But I'm only doing it to help Isabel out; she has the other.\"\n",
      "False The evening went quickly. When Leonard let down the window sashes and lowered the shades, Ruth, standing by the lamp as if to put out its light, said, \"I'll not go up for a moment or two yet.\"\n",

      "False  Ruth wrote to her lover. Her father's keeping secret his receipt of Godfrey's letter until he had mailed its answer, could mean only that the answer was for Godfrey to come home. The General's talk of being tired by the writing of it was a purely expletive irony, for he had written with the brevity of an old soldier to a young sailor; but he had written that trouble was impending, that its source was Arthur, and that the last hope of removing it lay with him, Godfrey.\n",
      "False A line from Ruth, pursuing after this message, would be one steamer behind it all the way, but it would reach the far wanderer before any leave would permit him to start homeward.\n",
      "False So, now, what should she write? If her father had discerned so much more than he had let any one know he had discerned, how about others? How about the kind whose chief joy is ruthless guesswork? _That_ need of haste was one she had overlooked. Wise father!\n",
      "False And yet--haste itself is such a hazardous thing! Ah, if Arthur had come in on that evening express, what to write were an easier question. The minutes sped by; her pen overhung the paper with the opening sentence unfinished, and every moment the thought she kept putting away came back: \"Leonard!--Leonard!--Godfrey's summons should go to him from Leonard; and it should flash under the seas, not crawl across them!\"--Hark!\n",

The Winslow house widened palely among its surrounding trees. The servants' rooms were remote as well as on the farther side, and on the nearer side no lamplight shone. A short way down the street a glow came from the Morris cottage. Evidently Isabel was with her mother.\n",
      "False He stood and mused, unconsciously lulled by the cool drip of myriad leaves, and with his mind poised midway between emotion and thought. To yield to emotion would have been to chafe against the bands that knitted his life and hers to every life about them. To yield to thought would have been to think of her as no more to be drawn from these surrounding ties than some animate rainbow-fringed flower of the sea can be torn from its shell without laceration and death. To give thought word would have been to cry, \"Oh, truest of womankind, where would this unsuspected man, this Leonard Byington, be if you were other than you are?\" Yet the suspense between avoided feeling and avoided thought held him where he stood.\n",
      "False So standing, it drifted idly into his mind that yonder arbor must be very wet to-night, and the cinder sidewalk out here much drier. As the thought moved him to draw one step back, the glow from the cottage broadened. Its front door had opened, and Mrs. Morris's young maid came out with a lantern, followed by Isabel saying last fond words to her mother as the convalescent closed the door.\n",
      "False \"Good-night!\" she called back.\n",
      "False In one great wave the young man's passion rolled over its bounds and brought him to his knees with arms outstretched. \"Oh, Isabel!\" he murmured. \"Oh, my God! Oh, Isabel! Isabel! if I had but lost you fairly!\"\n",
      "False The two slight figures came daintily along the wet path in single file, the maid throwing the lantern's beams hither and yon as she looked back to answer Isabel's kindly questions; Isabel one moment half lost in the gloom of the trees, and then so lighted up again from foot to brow that it was easy to see the very lines of her winsome mouth, ripe for compassion or fortitude, yet wishful as a little child's.\n",
      "False Her secret observer moaned as he stood erect. The fury of his soul seemed to enhance his stature. He did not speak again, but, \"Oh, Isabel! harder to strive against than all the world beside!\" was the unuttered cry that wrote itself upon his tortured brow. \"If your unfair winner would only hold you by fair means! Yet I too was to blame! I too was to blame, and you alone were blameless!\"\n",
      "False Opposite his window Isabel ceased her light talk with the maid, halted, bent, and scanned something just off the firm path, in the clean wet sand.\n",
      "False The maid turned and flooded her with the light of the lantern just as she impulsively lifted an alarmed glance to Leonard's window and as quickly averted it. \"Go on,\" said the mistress. \"I can walk faster if you can.\"\n",
      "False The girl quickened her steps, but had not taken a dozen when Isabel stopped again. \"Wait, Minnie. Now you can run back, thank you.\" She reached for the lantern.\n",
      "False \"I--I thought I was to go all the way, and--and bring the lantern back.\"\n",
      "False \"No, I'll keep the lantern; but I'll stay here and throw the light after you till you get in. Run along.\"\n",
      "False Minnie tripped away. As she came where they had first halted, a purposely belated good-night softly overtook her; and when she looked back, Isabel, as if by inadvertency, sent the lantern's beam into her eyes. So too much light sent the maid by the spot unenlightened.\n",
      "False Leonard drew aside lest the beam swing next into his window. But the precaution was wasted; the glare followed Minnie.\n",
      "False Isabel also followed, slowly, a few paces, and then moved obliquely into the roadway and toward the window. Only for a moment the ray swept near her unseen observer, and, lighting up the rain-packed sand close before herself, revealed a line of footprints slanting toward her from Leonard's own gate.\n",
      "False As the cottage door shut Minnie in, Isabel, reassured by the brightness of the Byingtons' lower windows, stopped for a furtive instant, and holding in her hand the fellow of the slipper so lately in Ruth's fingers, exactly fitted it to one of these footprints. Then, with the lantern on her farther side, and every vein surging with fright and shame, she made haste toward the open gateway of the Winslow house.\n",
      "False A short space from it she recoiled with a gesture of dismay and self-repression, and her light shone full upon a man. He stepped from the garden, his form tensely lifted, his face aflame with anger.\n",
      "False But her small figure straightened also, and swiftly muffling the lantern in a fold of her skirt, she exclaimed, audibly only to him, though in words clear-cut as musical notes, \"Oh, Arthur Winslow, has it come to this?\"\n",
      "False She arrested his resentful answer by the uplift of a hand, which left the lantern again uncovered. \"Inside! In the house!\" she softly cried, starting on. \"Not here! Look!--those upper windows!--we're in full view of them!\"\n",
      "False Quickly she remuffled the lantern, but not in time to hide his motion as he threw out an arm and pushed her rudely back, while he exclaimed, \"In full view of them answer me one question!\"\n",

      "False \"I on trial! God, listen to that!\"\n",
      "False He sprang after her, gripped her shoulders, and hung over her, snarling, \"You two-faced runaway! what have I done but suffer?\"\n",
      "False She kept the lantern hid. \"What have you done? Oh, my husband, will you hear if I tell you? You have hung the fates of all of us, living or yet to live, on one thread,--please, dear, don't bear so heavily on me,--on one poor thread which the jar of another misstep will surely break. Oh, let us not make it! Come, Arthur,--my husband,--into the house; maybe we can yet save ourselves and our dear ones! Arthur, you're hurting me dreadfully. If you press me down that way, you'll force me to my knees.\"\n",
      "False Still she spoke in undertone, and still she muffled the light, while steadily the weight of his arms increased. Suddenly he crowded her to the earth. \"Arthur,\" she murmured, \"Arthur, what are you going to do? Don't kill me here and now, Arthur; wait till to-morrow. I have that to pass through to-night which may end my life peaceably in bed; and if it should, then there will be no infamy on any of us,--on you or our child, living, or on me, dead; and Godfrey, and Ruth, and mother, and all can be\"--\n",
      "False \"Give me that lantern!\" He held her with one hand, snatched the light from cover, and thrust it into her face. \"So this is what you signal him with, is it?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh no, no! Arthur, dear, no! Before God's throne, no!\"\n",
      "False He lifted it as high as his arm would go, and with all his force swung it down, crashing and quenched, upon her head.\n",
      "False She gave a gentle sigh and rolled at his feet. Groaning with horror and fright, he lifted her in his arms and bore her to her room and bed.\n",
      "False There she presently opened her eyes to find him laving her face and head, moaning, covering them with kisses, and imploring her forgiveness in a thousand hysterical repetitions.\n",
      "False \"Hush, dear,\" she whispered. \"I see how it all happened. Does anybody know? Oh, God be thanked! don't let any one find out! It was all a misunderstanding. So many things crowded together to mislead you!\"\n",
      "False \"Oh yes, so many, many things at once, my treasure! Oh yes, yes!\"\n",
      "False \"Call Sarah, will you, dear?\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, beloved, why should I? You don't need Sarah for anything.\"\n",

      "False \"What has Arthur done?\" she asked. \"What is he doing?\"\n",
      "False \"Ruth! Ruth! he is putting her out of his own gate!\" The brother extended both hands to turn the sister from his path, but she twined her arms on his.\n",
      "False \"Leonard! Leonard! for the love of heaven, let him do it! She has only to go to her mother; let her go! It's the last hope. But she'd better be dead, and she'd a hundred times rather be dead, than that Leonard Byington should be her rescuer! Come in here a minute.\"\n",
      "False Slipping both hands into his she drew him into the lighted room, adding as they went, \"In a few minutes I can make some errand to her and find how matters stand\"--\n",
      "False They stumbled over a disordered rug. She fell into a chair; he sank to his knees, and with his face in her hands he moaned, \"Oh, Ruth! Oh, Ruth! it's my fault after all! I should have gone away at the beginning!\"\n",
      "False Ruth and Arthur met face to face in the Winslow garden. \"I was just coming for you,\" he said, excitedly.\n",

      "False \"Yes, her mother is with her, and\"--a sound of wheels--\"here's Giles, now, off for the doctor.\"\n",
      "False The servant passed. \"Yes, I got here by the sunset express. I couldn't stay away--with this impending.\"\n",
      "False \"I didn't see you come.\"\n",
      "False \"No, of course you didn't see me, for I didn't go to the station, and so I didn't pass anywhere near your house. I got off at the tank and came up the hill path.\"\n",
      "False \"You must have got drenched; you _are_ drenched.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh no! I got in before the rain began. Let myself in without seeing any one, and found Isabel was over at her mother's. So I waited here.\"\n",
      "False \"Didn't let her know you were home?\" asked Ruth, with a penetrating gaze.\n",
      "False \"No, I haven't been off the place since I came, but I stepped out so many times into the garden to see if she was coming that I'm soaking wet.\"\n",
      "False They entered the lighted house, and he turned upon her a glance heavy and wavering with falsehood. His tongue ran like a terrified horse. \"Oh--eh--before you go upstairs--Ruth--there's one thing I'm distressed about. I've told Mrs. Morris, and she's promised to see that the doctor understands it perfectly,--though I shall explain it to him myself the moment he comes. And still I wish you'd see that he understands, will you?\"\n",

      "False \"Why, at last, as I was waiting for Isabel, and saw her coming, I went to meet her. Unfortunately she took me for a stranger, turned to run, and tripped and fell headlong! She somehow got her lantern between the base of a tree and the crown of her head, smashed the lantern, and cut and bruised her head pitifully!\"\n",
      "False To hide her start of distress Ruth moved up the stair; but after a step or two she turned. \"Arthur, why say anything about it, if nothing is asked?\"\n",

      "False She nodded, but would not trust her eyes to meet his. He was right; she had divined his deed.\n",
      "False He went loiteringly into the library and gently closed the door. Then he turned the light low, paced once up and down the room, and all at once slammed himself full length upon a lounge, and lay face up, face down, by turns, writhing and tearing his hair.\n",
      "False Soon again he was pacing the floor, and presently was prone once more, and then once more up.\n",
      "False Giles, his English man, brought the doctor, and Arthur heard him discoursing as the vehicle drew up.\n",
      "False \"Yes, sir, quite so; quite so, sir. And yet I believe, sir, if h-all money and lands was 'eld in common, the 'ole 'uman ryce would be as 'appy as the gentlemen and lydies on Bylow 'Ill!\"\n",
      "False The young husband met the physician cheerily, sent him up, and went back to his solitude.\n",
      "False An hour passed, and then Sarah Stebbens knocked and leaned in. \"Mr. Arthur!\"\n",

      "False Even more delightful was it, when the time came round for the totality of her sex--the only sex worth considering--to call and see the babe and mother, to hear them all proclaim it the prettiest infant ever seen, and covertly pronounce Isabel more beautiful than on her wedding day.\n"

      "False In a way she was; and particularly when they fondly rallied her upon her new accession of motherly practical manner, and she laughed with them, and ended with that merry, mellow sigh which still gave Ruth new pride in her and new hope. But another source of Ruth's new hope was that Arthur, who had written to the bishop and resigned his calling the day after Mrs. Morris's little namesake was born, had at length withdrawn his letter.\n",
      "False \"It is to your brother we owe its withdrawal,\" said the bishop, privately, to Ruth.\n",
      "False She beamed gratefully, but did not tell him that, after the long, secret conference between her brother and the rector, Leonard had come to her and wept for Arthur the only tears he had ever shed in her presence. Now Leonard had found occasion to go West for a time, though he still held his office; and Arthur was filling the rectorate almost in the old first way. On some small parish matter the rustic vestryman with the spectacled daughter came to Arthur's library in better spirits than he had shown for months, and by and by asked conjecturally, \"I--eh--guess you don't keep any babies here you're ashamed to show, do ye?\" and held his mouth very wide open.\n",

      "False So went matters for a time, and then, while the babe began to fill out and lengthen out, Isabel showed herself daily more and more overspent. The physician reappeared, and spoke plainly:--\n",
      "False \"And if your cousin down South is so determined to have you at her wedding, why, go! Leave your baby with your mother; she's older in the business than you are.\"\n",
      "False But the cousin's wedding was weeks away yet, and Isabel clung to her wee treasure, and temporized with the aunts and cousins in the South and with her mother and Ruth at home, until the doctor spoke again.\n",
      "False \"Let's see,\" he said to Arthur. \"This is November, baby's five months old. Send your wife away. Put her out! Something's killing her by inches, and I believe it's just care o' the nest. We must drive her off it, as I drove Leonard Byington off,--which, you remember, you, quietly, were the first to suggest to me to do.... Coming back, you say,--Byington? Yes, but only for a day or two,--election time.\"\n",

Giles piled the fagots; but at a late moment, to the disgust of Giles and Minnie, the older pair pitilessly changed their minds, and decided they were too old to make such nincompoops of themselves. Minnie would not go without Sarah, for Minnie was up to her pretty eyebrows in love with Giles, as well as immensely correct; and so there, as it seemed, was the end of that.\n",
      "False At tea Arthur told Isabel he was going for a long walk down through the town and across the meadows, and would not be home before bedtime. Isabel approved heartily, and said Sarah would stay near the sleeping babe, and she would spend the evening with her mother. She and Arthur went together as far as the cross-paths in the arbor, and there, in parting, he clasped and kissed her with a sudden frenzy that only added one more distressful misgiving to the many that now haunted her days.\n",
      "False She found her mother alone. They sat down, hand in hand, before an open fire, and had talked in sweet quietness but a short while, when a chance word and the knowledge that this time they would not be interrupted made it easy for Isabel to say things she had for weeks been trying to say.\n",

Godfrey had not come. He had not looked for him to appear with a hop, skip, and a jump, \"a man under authority\" as he was; but here were five months gone.\n",
      "False \"I can't clamor for him,\" thought he, and feared Ruth had written him that the emergency was past. And so she had, in those days of new hope and new suspense which had followed for a while Arthur's withdrawal of his resignation.\n",
      "False At the fireside below sat Leonard and Ruth, not hand in hand, like Isabel and her mother, yet conversing on the same theme as they.\n",

His fortunes were growing. Yet that was not a thing to be wordy about, and now, when the murmur of his voice continued so long and steadily that it found even the dulled ear of the aged father in the upper room, that father knew what the topic must be. On all other matters the son and brother had become more silent than ever,--was being nicknamed far and near, flatteringly and otherwise, for his reticence; but let Ruth sit down with him alone and barely draw near this theme,--this wound,--and his speech bled from him and would not be stanched.\n",

Oh, Ruth, I love that little bird-box, spite of all its spunky beliefs and twittering complacencies. I wanted to save it and him; and over and over there has seemed such good ground of hope in him. It's been always so unbelievable that he should utterly fail us. Ruth, if you could have seen his contrition the night I tore up that shameful, servile resignation! I don't need to see Isabel to know he is wearing the soul out of her. You needn't have answered one of my questions,--which I honor you for answering so unwillingly; Mrs. Morris gave me their answer in five minutes, though we talked only of investments. And Mrs. Morris needn't have given it; to see Arthur himself is enough. All the genuineness has gone out of the man,--out of his words, out of his face, out of his voice.

Presently their ear caught a stir at the side of the Morris cottage.\n",

      "True [Illustration: \"But to know every day and hour that I'm watched.\"]\n",
      "False So standing and distressfully musing, she heard the click of the Byingtons' door as Ruth left Leonard on the porch. But her thought went after Arthur. Where was he? That he had honestly gone where he had said he was going she painfully doubted. She stirred to move on, but had not taken a step when a feminine cry of terror set her blood leaping and sent her flying down the arbor, and where the two paths crossed she and Leonard met at such a speed that only by seizing her with both his hands did he avoid trampling her down. The scream was repeated again and again.\n",
      "False \"It's Minnie!\" cried Isabel as they sprang down the path to the mill pond; and Leonard, outrunning her, called back,--\n",

      "False The next moment he, and then she, were on the scene. Minnie stood on the firmer ice away from the bank, moaning in continued agitation, but already rescued. It was Arthur Winslow who had saved her.\n",
      "False Now he gained the bank with the dripping girl, where he yielded her to his wife, and without a word from him, from Isabel, or from Leonard to any one but the incessantly talking maid, the four hurried up the path. When they reached the arbor Ruth had joined them, and there the three women turned to the cottage. Leonard passed on toward his home. Arthur went into his own house.\n",
      "False In the cottage, while being hurried into dry clothes, Minnie more coherently explained her mishap. Wishing to play a joke on Giles, she had slipped away from the fireside company of him and Sarah to put a match to his fagots on the pond, run back with word that they were burning, and laugh with Sarah while Giles should plunge out to find the incendiaries. But she had forgotten how frail good ice may be against a warm bank, and leaping down, had promptly broken through. She had had the fortune to hold on by the ice's outer edge until Arthur, whom she felt sure only Providence could have sent there, drew her out. She was tearfully ashamed, yet not so broken in spirit but she fiercely vowed she would get even with Giles for this yet.\n",
      "False Leonard went to his room, Arthur to his, and each in his way shut himself in to darkness, silence, and the fury of his own heart.\n",
      "False One of the things most harrowing to Leonard was that, at every turn, the active part fell to Arthur, while him fate held mercilessly to the passive; and his soul writhed in unworded prayer for any conceivable turn of events that would give him leave to act, to do!\n",

Presently, holding a lamp, she stood in the door between her room and Arthur's, lifted the light above her head, and, shading her brows, called his name. Hidden in the gloom, silent and motionless, he stared for a moment on the beautiful apparition, and then moved without a sound into the beams of the lamp, a picture of misery and desperation.\n",
      "False \"Why in the dark?\" amiably inquired the wife.\n",

That will save me from the faces--the white, white faces that float on that black pool down yonder, and move their accusing lips at me: _his_ face--and mine--and thine. Oh, Isabel, until you stood before me in the golden light of your lamp, transfigured into a messenger from heaven, it was in my lost soul to do the deed this night.\"\n",

This is all in your tortured imagination, and there, though you had not seen me, it would have stayed; you never would have come to the act. Arthur, your soul is not lost. You who have pointed the way of escape and deliverance so clearly and savingly to so many, you need not miss it now yourself.\"\n",

She tenderly disengaged herself, left him in the door, moved on to the child's crib, and in the dim light of the bedside taper, facing him from beyond it, soothed the little one by her silent touch.\n",
      "False To Arthur, wan and frail though she was, the sight was heavenly fair, a vision of ineffable peace to which it seemed a sacrilege to draw nearer; but she beckoned, and he stole to the spot.

      "False  Isabel went to her couch in great heaviness and agitation. Her sad confidings to her mother, Minnie's adventure, Arthur's pitiful if not alarming condition, she strove to reconsider duly and in their order; but perpetually there interfered, with its every smallest detail thrillingly clear and strong, that moment which had thrown her once more into the company, tossed her into the very clutch, of Leonard Byington. She turned her face into her pillow and prayed God for other thoughts and visions, and at length, while charging herself to see her mother in time to postpone the sending of her dispatch to Godfrey, she slept.\n",
      "False Sleep, of a sort, came also to Arthur, though not before many an evil imagination had come back to tease and sting his galled mind.\n",
      "False What chafed oftenest was the fact that Isabel, had he allowed it, would have sought to argue down his belief that Leonard loved her. Great heaven! what must be her feeling toward him, that she should offer to argue such a question? She might truly deny all knowledge of his passion, but oh, where were her quick outcries of womanly abhorrence? Where was the word that Leonard Byington was no more to her than any other man,--that word which would have been the first to flash from her if conscience had not stopped it? Twice he sprang up in his bed, whispering: \"They love! They love! Each knows it of the other! They love!\"\n",
      "False The second time, as he stared, suddenly he saw them! They stood just beyond the foot of his couch, wrapped in each other's arms. Choking with wrath, freezing with horror, he slid to the floor; but at his first step they floated apart. Isabel glided toward her own door, fading as she went, and dissolved in a broad moonbeam. Leonard, as he receded, grew every instant more real, until, at his pursuer's second step, he melted through a window and was gone. Arthur sprang to the spot and stared out and down; but all he saw was the moon, the frosty night, and the silent, motionless garden.\n",
      "False With a whisper of fierce purpose he turned and noiselessly threw on his clothes, then clutched his head in his hands in a wild effort to recall what the purpose was, and by and by lay quietly down again on his bed. He could not recollect; but the inner tumult quieted more and more, and after a time, without putting off any part of his dress, he drew the bedcovers over himself, and in a few moments was partially asleep. So for an hour or more he lay in half-waking dreams, ghastly with phantoms and breathless with dismay of his own ferocious strivings. Then he rose once more, and, with the noiselessness which habit had perfected, left his room, moved down the upper hall and the stair, and let himself out into the garden. Wadded in his arms he bore one or two of the coverings from his bed. He took his way to the pond.\n",
      "False He was walking in his sleep.\n",
      "False At an earlier day Isabel would have been awakened by her husband's softest movement; but now, used to his stirrings, weary in body and mind, and in some degree reassured, she slept on unstartled until Arthur's return.\n",
      "False He came as silently as he had gone, and was empty-handed. He had tied a great stone in the two bed-coverings, and through the thin new ice of the hole where Minnie had broken in had sunk them in the black depth under the shelving rock. He was still asleep.\n",
      "False The door between the two chambers gave a faint sound as he opened it, yet neither mother nor child moved. A moment passed, and he had reached the bed. Another went by, and Isabel was awake, wildly but vainly trying to scream, to rise. A knee was on her bosom, two hands grappled her throat, and two out-starting eyes were close to hers. Her husband was strangling her.\n",
      "False Then he too awoke. With a horrified cry he recoiled, and she, for the first time in her life in a transport of terror, hurled him, in the strength of her frenzy, to the farther side of the bed, and writhing out on the opposite side, crept under it and lay still. In a torture of bewilderment and remorse Arthur buried his face in the bedside. Then, helpless to distinguish what he had done from what he had dreamed, he sprang back to the place where Isabel had lain sleeping, and lo, it was empty.\n",
      "False \"Oh, was it thou, was it thou?\" he wailed, in a stifled voice. \"Was it not he?\"\n",
      "False Whispering and moaning her name, hearkening and groping, he sought her from corner to corner, first of her room and then of his own, and then went to the hall and to other rooms in the same harrowing quest.\n",
      "False Isabel crept forth and darted to her babe. Yet as she leaned to take it in her arms her better judgment told her the child was safe. The husband too, and every one beside, were safer from his jealous wrath while the babe remained. With one anguished knitting of her hands over it she left it, and fled in her night-dress. Arthur's course was made plain by his moanings, and easily avoiding him, she glided down a back stair, out into the arbor, and across to her mother's cottage and bed-chamber. As she did so he returned hurriedly to his room, with low cries of less wretched conviction, and looked eagerly under his bed and then under hers. Thereupon the last hope died, and he dropped to his face on the floor in abject agony.\n",

If he had truly been there and done this appalling thing, he would know it by the empty imprint of the boulder he had taken from its resting place of years. If he had not, then Isabel had fled to her mother and would be found with her in the morning, and the blot of her murder, though it blackened his soul, was yet not on his hands.\n",
      "False He went to the water, and soon he came again with the step and face of one called out of his grave. Slowly he counted the disordered coverings of his wife's couch, stood a moment in desolate perplexity, and then went quickly and counted those of his own. A sheet and a blanket were gone. He turned to a closet and supplied the lack, and then paced the floor until dawn.\n",
      "False Before the servants were fairly astir he laid away the clothing Isabel had put off, and contrived to leave the house and pass through the arbor unseen until he reached its farther end; but there Mrs. Morris, in a dressing gown, opened to him before he could knock. She forced her usual laugh, but he saw the white preparedness of her face.\n",
      "False \"She knows my crime,\" he thought, and was in agony to guess how she had got the knowledge and what she would do with it.\n",

      "False \"Wait, mother; listen. I beseech you. Do you absolutely know she's not here?\"\n",
      "False \"I know it! Oh, Arthur, are you only trying to break bad news to me by littles? Has Isabel destroyed herself? Has she fled?\" The inquirer played well now; her pallor, that had seemed to accuse him, was gone, and her question offered a cue which he greedily took.\n",
      "False \"Fled? Isabel! Destroyed herself,--that spotless soul? Oh no, no, no! But Oh merciful God! I am afraid she has been stolen!\" He sank into a seat and dropped his face into his hands.\n",
      "False The maid's steps sounded overhead, and he started up. Mrs. Morris laid a hand on his arm. She was pale again, but her words were reassuring.\n",
      "False \"It's Minnie,\" she murmured: \"let me go and see her. She'll not be surprised; I'm always the first one up.\" She went, and was soon back again.\n",

      "False \"No, you must go. Go search for every clue that will tell us a word of her; but, whatever you do, let no one, not even Sarah, know she is missing, until we know enough ourselves to protect her from every shadow of reproach!\"\n",
      "False \"True! true! right! right!\" said Arthur, while with secret terror he cried to himself: \"This woman knows! She knows, she knows, and all this is make-believe, put on to gain time!\"\n",
      "False But he saw no safer course than to help on the sham. \"Right,\" he said again; \"only, mother, dear, how shall we hide her absence?\"\n",
      "False \"We needn't hide it. You know she got another telegram last night, begging her to come at once to the wedding. We can say she went on this morning's train, before day; it makes such good Southern connections. And now go! make your search with all your might! and after a while I'll come over and pack a trunk full of her things, and express it South, just as if she were there, and had gone so hurriedly that--Don't you see?\"\n",
      "False Arthur said he saw it all, but he did not; he saw much that was not, and much that was he saw not. He did not see that the dust of the old street, and of the new town as well, was on Mrs. Morris's shoes; and that Isabel, in a gown which she had left at the cottage when she went to be mistress of his home, was really on the train, bound South.\n",
      "False Dropping all pretence of having any search to make, he hurried back to his own room, and by and by told the pleasantly astonished Sarah and Giles the simple truth as Mrs. Morris had put it into his mouth, but told it in the firm belief that he was covering a hideous crime with an all but transparent lie.\n",
      "False After a false show of breakfasting he went into his study,--\"to work on his sermon,\" he said; but did nothing there but pace the floor, hold his head, and whisper, \"It will not last an hour after _he_ has heard it,\" and, \"O God, have mercy!

      "True A DOUBLE STILL HUNT\n",
      "False  Mrs. Morris's task was too large for her. She had always taken such care of her innocence that her cultivation of the virtues had been only incidental. Hence, morally, she had more fat than fibre; and hence again, though to her mind guilt was horrible, publicity was so much worse that her first and ruling impulse toward any evil doing not her own was to conceal it. That was her form of worldliness, the only fault she felt certain she was free from. And here she was, without a helping hand or a word of counsel, laboring to hide from the servants and from the dear Byingtons, from the church and from a scoffing world, the hideous fact that Isabel was a fugitive from the murderous wrath of a jealous husband, and that the rector of All Angels had crumbled into moral ruin.\n",
      "False \"And oh,\" she cried, \"is it the worst of it, or is it the best of it, that in this awful extremity he keeps so sane, so marvellously sane?\" She said this the oftener because every few hours some new sign to the contrary forced itself upon her notice. Oblivion was her cure-all.\n",
      "False For a while after his conference with Mrs. Morris Arthur made some feeble show--for her eye alone--of looking after clews, and then, as much to her joy as to her amazement, told her it was a part of his detective strategy to return into his study, and seemingly to his ordinary work, until time would allow certain unfoldings for which he looked with confidence.\n",
      "False \"Have you found out anything?\" she asked, with a glaringly false eagerness that gave him a new panic of suspicion and whetted his cunning.\n",
      "False He said he had, but must beg her not to ask yet what it was. Then he inquired if any neighbor had left town that morning for Boston, and her heart rose into her throat as she marked the subtlety he could not keep out of his dark face.\n",
      "False \"Why, ye--yes--n--no, no one that I know of ex--except Leonard Byington,\" she replied, and thought, \"If he should accuse Leonard, we are undone!\"\n",
      "False To avoid that risk she would have told him, then and there, all she knew, had she not feared she might draw his rage upon herself for aiding the wife's flight. She must, must, must keep on good terms with him till she and Isabel could somehow get the child. So passed the awful hours, mother and husband each marvelling in agony over the ghastly puzzle of the other's apathy.\n",
      "False Later in the day she knocked timorously at his study door. She had come with a silly little proposition that he let her take the infant and go South as if to join Isabel. Thus the trunk would not lie in the express office down there, unclaimed and breeding awkward inquiries, and she from that point, with him at this, could keep up the illusion they had invented until Isabel herself should--eh--return!\n",
      "False But when he let her in, he stood before her a silent embodiment of such remorse and foreboding that she could have burst into sobs and cries.\n",
      "False Yet she broached her plan, trembling visibly, while he heard her through with melancholy deference.\n",
      "False In reply he commended it, but called to her notice how much better it would be for her to go alone. Then the babe, left behind, would be an unspoken yet most eloquent guarantee that its mother would soon reappear.\n",
      "False \"Very true,\" responded the emboldened lady; \"yet on the other hand\"--\n",
      "False He put out an interrupting touch. \"The child is as safe with me as if it were in its mother's bosom.\"\n",
      "False \"Oh, it isn't so much a question of safety as\"--\n",
      "False The father interrupted again, with a gleam in his eyes like the outflashing of a knife. \"I hold the child against all comers, and would if I had to slay its mother to do it.\"\n",
      "False Mrs. Morris stifled an outcry and would have left him, but he would not let her.\n",
      "False \"Stay! Oh, listen to a soul in torment! The babe is already motherless. Isabel can never return, mother; she is with the dead. I am not waiting idly here for her; I am waiting busily--for her slayer. He has fled; but when he sees he is not pursued he will come back to the spot,--to the black, black hole. He cannot help it. I _know_ that. Oh, how well I know it! And the moment he comes he is caught,--caught in the web of proofs I am weaving!\"\n",
      "False He held her arm and gazed into her gazing eyes in ferocious fear of the web she might be weaving for him; while she, reeling sick with fear of him, tried with all her shaken wits to sham an impassioned accord.\n",

      "False Nor need we draw a close portrait of her husband's mind, if mind it could longer be called. A horror of sleep, a horror of being awake and aware, remorse, phantoms, voices, sudden blazings of wrath as suddenly gone, sweating panics, that craven care of life which springs so rank as the soul decays, and a steady, cunning determination to keep whole the emptied shell of reputation and rank,--these were the things that filled his hours by day, by night; these, and a frightful expectance of one accusing, child-claiming ghost that never came. The air softened to Indian summer; the ice faded off the pool; a million leaves, crimson and bronze, scarlet and gold, dropped tenderly upon its silvering breadth and lay still; and both the joyless master of the larger house and the merry maid of the cottage asked Heaven impatiently if the pond would never freeze over again.\n",
      "False It was Saturday afternoon when Giles, asked by Sarah Stebbens where Mr. Arthur was, told her he was again, as he had been so many times the last three days, down by the water, sitting at the edge of the overhanging bank; or, as the Englishman expressed it, \"'dreamink the 'appy hours aw'y.'\" So the week passed out; a second came in, and the rector of All Angels went to his sacred office.\n",
      "False He knew, before he appeared in the chancel, that Mrs. Morris was in her accustomed place, and Ruth and her father in theirs, and that Leonard was not yet reported back nor looked for; but exactly as he began to read, \"'Dearly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places, to acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness, and that we should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father'\"--a sickness filled Mrs. Morris's frame, a deathly hue overspread the minister's face, and Leonard came in and sat beside his father and sister.\n",
      "False Yet the service went on. The people knelt.\n",
      "False \"'Almighty and most merciful Father; We have erred, and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts'\"--\n",
      "False Thus far the rector's voice had led, but here it sank, and the old General's, in a measure, took its place.\n",
      "False Then it rose again, in the confession, \"There is no health in us,\" and in the supplication, \"Have mercy upon us, miserable offenders.\"\n",
      "False There once more it failed, while the people, faltering with distress, repeated, \"That we may hereafter lead a godly, righteous, and sober life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.\"\n",
      "False At this the farmer with the spectacled daughter stepped nimbly over the rail and caught Arthur as he rose and staggered. Leonard was hurrying forward, and half the people kneeling, half standing, when Mrs. Morris vacantly stopped his way with a face so aghast and words so confused that he had to give her over to Ruth. Then he hastened on to where Arthur was being led into the vestry by his physician and others.\n",
      "False But now he was turned back by the doctor, requesting him to dismiss the congregation; which he did, with the physician's assurance that the trouble was no more than vertigo, and that Arthur was even now quite able to proceed home in the farmer vestryman's rockaway. The people noticed that the physician went with him.\n",
      "False Mrs. Morris followed on foot with the farmer's daughter, and with Ruth and the General, and Leonard went into town to telegraph Isabel, in her mother's name, to come home. As he was starting, Mrs. Morris drew Ruth aside and whispered something about Godfrey. To which Ruth softly replied, with an affectionate twist in her smile, \"It couldn't hurry him; he's already on the way.\"\n",
      "False In the room next that in which her son-in-law lay asleep under anodynes the little mother's odd laugh was turned all to moan. \"Oh!--ho--ho!\" she sighed in solitude, \"if Arthur could have learned from Godfrey how to wait, or even if Isabel could but have learned from Ruth how to keep one waiting!\"\n",
      "False She paused at a window that looked over the garden and into the street. Leonard passed. She turned quickly away, only sighing again, \"Oh!--ho--ho!\" Her thought might have been kinder had she known he was stabbing himself at every step with blame of all this woe.\n",
      "False \"I ought to have foreseen,\" was his constant silent cry. \"I am the one who ought to have foreseen.\"\n",
      "False Lack of Sunday trains and two failures to connect kept Isabel from arriving until nightfall of the third day, Wednesday. Arthur knew Mrs. Morris had telegraphed for her; but to him that was only part of the play under which he thought he and she were hiding the frightful truth.\n",
      "False On this day he had so outwitted his village physician as to be given the freedom for which he ravened; liberty to take the air in his garden, as understood by the doctor, but by him liberty to stand guard down at the edge of that dark pool which would not freeze over,--liberty to take an air sweet with the odors of the parting year, but crowded also with distended eyes and strangling groans.\n",

      "False Isabel's heart beat fast. She had made her change of dress, and in a far corner of her room, with her face toward the open door that let into his, was again leaning with a mother's ecstasy over the sleeping babe, when she heard his step.\n",

The endless moment wore away, and there on the threshold he stood--if that--Oh merciful God!--if that was Arthur Winslow.\n",

      "False \"Do you hear it, Leonard?\" cried the wife. \"Oh, you do hear it, don't you, Leonard?\"\n",
      "False There was no answer. For a moment Leonard's own form relaxed, and he turned his face and buried it in the unresponsive breast. Then he lifted it again, and taking the other face between his hands he sank his brow to the brow upturned and cried: \"God rest your soul, Arthur! Oh, Arthur, Arthur, God rest your soul!\"\n",

Let bygones be bygones, and accept as a proof of my continuing friendship the dedication of this little volume, in which there are no other sums than those of the Telegraph.', 'The hustling methods of modernity possess undoubted possibilities for humorous treatment, and no one has appreciated the fact more keenly than the authors of \"Wisdom While you Wait.\" In this their latest work the prospectus of the Napolio Syndicate forms a bowstring whence fly shafts of satire that hit the mark every time.', '~The Soul of London.~ FORD MADOX HUEFFER. Author of \"The Life of Madox Brown,\" \"The Face of the Night,\" &c. Imperial 16mo, 5s. nett.', 'It is one thing to be a famous writer; it is another to be widely read. Maxim Gorky is at present included in both categories, though as regards the second condition he had scarcely qualified prior to the publication of \"Creatures that once were Men. \" It was a bold venture, for all the former successes in shilling form were either sensationally melodramatic or frankly farcical.Encouraged by the huge demand for Maxim Gorky\\'s book, Mr. Alston Rivers is publishing in the same form (1/- nett, paper, and 1/6 cloth) \"Publican and Serf,\" by Skitaletz, a Russian Author, who, while by no means behind Gorky in point of realism, possesses in the opinion of some critics a still greater measure of literary ability.', 'Other items of Mr. Alston Rivers\\' Shilling Library, which has prospered as only the result of the most careful selection could prosper, are \"Lovers in London,\" by A.A. Milne, brightest and most promising of the younger humorists, and \"The Loot of Cities,\" by Mr. Arnold Bennett, the mere name of whom is a sufficient guarantee of entertainment. As for general literature, \"The Soul of London,\" by Ford Madox Hueffer, may be justly described as worthy of a place in every library.The author in his introduction, remarks that he has tried to make the book anything rather than encyclopædic, topographical, or archæological, and beyond that somewhat negative phrase it is difficult to give any more complete designation to the work.', 'For the treatment of the subject is altogether original, this attraction being intensified by the particularly graceful style in which a remarkable gift of observation finds expression.', 'Mr. Reginald Turner has already achieved such distinction as an author of superior fiction (witness the success of his \"Comedy of Progress\" and \"Cynthia\\'s Damages,\") that a cordial reception was assured for his latest book \"Peace on Earth. \" It is a pathetic story that he has to tell; of the sorrows of the outcast amid poverty, and the rage against law and government provoked thereby; of the less obvious, but equally poignant, griefs which smoulder beneath the surface of \"comfortable circumstances. \"The plot is, in short, one that in the hands of any other than a thorough man of the world, would fail hopelessly, which makes Mr. Turner\\'s complete and undoubted success all the more meritorious.', '\"The Countermine\" is the work of Mr. Arthur Wenlock, whose \"As Down of Thistle\" showed considerable promise, though perhaps his subtle vein of sardonic philosophy escaped due recognition. As its name denotes, the interest in the new novel is largely military; in every line the soldier, with his nice sense of honour, his virility, and his direct methods, stands revealed. \"The Countermine\" is certainly a most thrilling tale, and should raise the author to the front rank of writers on \"Service\" topics.Of Mr. Thomas Cobb, whose reputation is already firmly established, it is only necessary to say that in \"The Friendships of Veronica\" his fertile and resourceful pen is at its best if, indeed, his literary reputation has not been substantially advanced.', 'In a wholly different vein are \"The Discipline of Christine\" and \"The Unequal Yoke,\" by Mrs. Barré Goldie and Mrs. H.H. Penrose respectively. In the former the ways and moods of childhood are depicted in original and inimitable fashion, which makes it safe to predict that the author will go far beyond her first effort as a novelist.In \"The Unequal Yoke\" Mrs. Penrose has taken for her theme the love story of a clergyman whose benefice is an Irish coast town, and in whose flock prominence is attained by narrow zeal rather than by amiability.', \"He is really a good man, and is lucky enough, or the reverse, to win the hand of a delightful young lady whose charms, however, do not command the unanimous approval of the parishioners. The possession of high musical attainments makes her temperament all the more interesting, and accounts for the presence in so remote a district of her German friend whose acute sense of the ridiculous leads to such untoward results. It is hard to say whether the author's talents are best evinced by her true pathos or by the delicate touches of humour which pervade the book.Another commendable feature of the novel is an alert skill in construction which stamps it as a thoroughly artistic production.\", 'In issuing a list of new and forthcoming publications, Mr. Alston Rivers cannot but express his gratification at the spirit of fair play which has enabled him to realise such a striking series of successes. The primary business of a publisher is to discriminate, both as to intrinsic literary merit, and with regard to what will hit the public taste, a classical illustration of the difficulty in gauging the latter being the rejection of \"John Inglesant\" by the late James Payn, then \"reader\" for an eminent firm.While fully recognising the remarkable gifts of the author Mr. Payn\\'s hesitancy as to the book\\'s attractions got the better of his judgment; and with \"The House of Merrilees\" it is now an open secret that very much the same point of view was taken in more than one instance.', 'Mr. Marshall\\'s \"Peter Binney, Undergraduate,\" had been and is still decidedly popular, but his new book was more ambitious, possessing such a plot as to require peculiarly delicate handling. Had it been handled in a way that combined a really high literary standard with more stirring qualities? The question requires no answer now, for the triumph which the publisher at once foretold on reading the manuscript has been more than attained, and \"The House of Merrilees\" is indisputably the novel of the season.It has at the same time demonstrated to the publishing trade that a sensational story does not labour under any disadvantage by the abduction of literary style.']\n",

       "['There is another expression which must be considered in connexion with the mediæval doctrine of deification. This is the intellectus agens, or [Greek: nous poiêtikos], which began its long history in Aristotle (De Anima, iii. 5). Aristotle there distinguishes two forms of Reason, which are related to each other as form and matter.Reason becomes all things, for the matter of anything is potentially the whole class to which it belongs; but Reason also makes all things, that is to say, it communicates to things those categories by which they become objects of thought.',\n",
       " 'This higher Reason is separate and impassible ([Greek: chôristos kai amigês kai apathês]); it is eternal and immortal; while the passive reason perishes with the body. The creative Reason is immanent both in the human mind and in the external world; and thus only is it possible for the mind to know things. Unfortunately, Aristotle says very little more about his [Greek: nous poiêtikos], and does not explain how the two Reasons are related to each other, thereby leaving the problem for his successors to work out.The most fruitful attempt to form a consistent theory, on an idealistic basis, out of the ambiguous and perhaps irreconcilable statements in the De Anima, was made by Alexander of Aphrodisias (about 200 A.D.), who taught that the Active Reason \"is not a part or faculty of our soul, but comes to us from without\"--it is, in fact, identified with the Spirit of God working in us.',\n",
       " 'Whether Aristotle would have accepted this interpretation of his theory may be doubted; but the commentary of Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Arabic, and this view of the Active Reason became the basis of the philosophy of Averroes. Averroes teaches that it is possible for the passive reason to unite itself with the Active Reason, and that this union may be attained or prepared for by ascetic purification and study. But he denies that the passive reason is perishable, not wishing entirely to depersonalise man.Herein he follows, he says, Themistius, whose views he tries to combine with those of Alexander.',\n",
       " 'Avicenna introduces a celestial hierarchy, in which the higher intelligences shed their light upon the lower, till they reach the Active Reason, which lies nearest to man, \"a quo, ut ipse dicit, effluunt species intelligibiles in animas nostras\" (Aquinas). The doctrine of \"monopsychism\" was, of course, condemned by the Church. Aquinas makes both the Active and Passive Reason parts of the human soul.Eckhart, as I have said in the fourth Lecture, at one period of his teaching expressly identifies the \"intellectus agens\" with the \"spark,\" in reference to which he says that \"here God\\'s ground is my ground, and my ground God\\'s ground.',\n",
       " 'This doctrine of the Divinity of the ground of the soul is very like the Cabbalistic doctrine of the Neschamah, and the Neoplatonic doctrine of [Greek: Nous] (cf. Stöckl, vol. ii. p. 1007). Eckhart was condemned for saying, \"aliquid est in anima quod est increatum et increabile; si tota anima esset talis, esset increata et increabilis. Hoc est intellectus.\" Eckhart certainly says explicitly that \"as fire turns all that it touches into itself, so the birth of the Son of God in the soul turns us into God, so that God no longer knows anything in us but His Son.',\n",
       " 'Man thus becomes \"filius naturalis Dei,\" instead of only \"filius adoptivus. \" We have seen that Eckhart, towards the end of his life, inclined more and more to separate the spark, the organ of Divine contemplation, from the reason. This is, of course, an approximation to the other view of deification--that of substitution or miraculous infusion from without, unless we see in it a tendency to divorce the personality from the reason.Ruysbroek states his doctrine of the Divine spark very clearly: \"The unity of our spirit in God exists in two ways, essentially and actively.',\n",
       " 'The essential existence of the soul, quæ secundum æternam ideam in Deo nos sumus, itemque quam in nobis habemus, medii ac discriminis expers est. Spiritus Deum in nuda natura essentialiter possidet, et spiritum Deus.Vivit namque in Deo et Deus in ipso; et secundum supremam sui partem Dei claritatem suscipere absque medio idoneus est; quin etiam per æterni exemplaris sui claritudinem essentialiter ac personaliter in ipso lucentis, secundum supremam vivacitatis suæ portionem, in divinam sese demittit ac demergit essentiam, ibidemque perseveranter secundum ideam manendo æternam suam possidet beatitudinem; rursusque cum creaturis omnibus per æternam Verbi generationem inde emanans, in esse suo creato constituitur.',\n",
       " 'The \"natural union,\" though it is the first cause of all holiness and blessedness, does not make us holy and blessed, being common to good and bad alike. \"Similitude\" to God is the work of grace, \"quæ lux quædam deiformis est. \" We cannot lose the \"unitas,\" but we can lose the \"similitudo quæ est gratia.\" The highest part of the soul is capable of receiving a perfect and immediate impression of the Divine essence; by this \"apex mentis\" we may \"sink into the Divine essence, and by a new (continuous) creation return to our created being according to the idea of God.',\n",
       " 'The question whether the \"ground of the soul\" is created or not is obviously a form of the question which we are now discussing. Giseler, as I have said, holds that it was created with the soul. Sterngassen says: \"That which God has in eternity in uncreated wise, that has the soul in time in created wise.\"But the author of the Treatise on Love, which belongs to this period, speaks of the spark as \"the Active Reason, which is God.\"And again, \"This is the Uncreated in the soul of which Master Eckhart speaks.\" Suso seems to imply that he believed the ground of the soul to be uncreated, an emanation of the Divine nature; and Tauler uses similar language.',\n",
       " 'Ruysbroek, in the last chapter of the Spiritual Nuptials, says that contemplative men \"see that they are the same simple ground as to their uncreated nature, and are one with the same light by which they see, and which they see. \" The later German mystics taught that the Divine essence is the material substratum of the world, the creative will of God having, so to speak, alienated for the purpose a portion of His own essence. If, then, the created form is broken through, God Himself becomes the ground of the soul.Even Augustine countenances some such notion when he says, \"From a good man, or from a good angel, take away \\'man\\' or \\'angel,\\' and you find God.\"',\n",
       " 'But one of the chief differences between the older and later Mysticism is that the former regarded union with God as achieved through the faculties of the soul, the latter as inherent in its essence. The doctrine of immanence, more and more emphasised, tended to encourage the belief that the Divine element in the soul is not merely something potential, something which the faculties may acquire, but is immanent and basal. Tauler mentions both views, and prefers the latter.Some hesitation may be traced in the Theologia Germanica on this point (p. 109, \"Golden Treasury\" edition): \"The true light is that eternal Light which is God; or else it is a created light, but yet Divine, which is called grace.',\n",
       " '\" Our Cambridge Platonists naturally revived this Platonic doctrine of deification, much to the dissatisfaction of some of their contemporaries. Tuckney speaks of their teaching as \"a kind of moral divinity minted only with a little tincture of Christ added. Nay, a Platonic faith unites to God!\"Notwithstanding such protests, the Platonists persisted that all true happiness consists in a participation of God; and that \"we cannot enjoy God by any external conjunction with Him.\"']"

    "naval_warfare_paragraph = \"\"\"I have so far treated blockade as the initial stage of a struggle for the command of the sea. That appears to me to be the logical order of treatment, because when two naval Powers go to war it is almost certain that the stronger of the two will at the outset attempt to blockade the naval forces of the other. The same thing is likely to happen even if the two are approximately equal in naval force, but in that case the blockade is not likely to be of long duration, because both sides will be eager to obtain a decision in the open. The command of the sea is a matter of such vital moment to both sides that each must needs seek to obtain it as soon and as completely as possible, and the only certain way to obtain it is by the destruction of the armed forces of the enemy. The advantage of putting to sea first is in naval warfare the equivalent or counterpart of the advantage in land warfare of first crossing the enemy's frontier. If that advantage is pushed home and the enemy is still unready it must lead to a blockade. It is, moreover, quite possible that even if both belligerents are equally ready—I am[Pg 21] here assuming them to be approximately equal in force—one or other, if not both, may think it better strategy to await developments before risking everything in an attempt to secure an immediate decision. In point of fact, the difference between this policy and the policy of a declared blockade is, as I am about to show, almost imperceptible, especially in modern conditions of naval warfare. It is therefore necessary to consider the subject of blockade more in detail. Other subjects closely associated with this will also have to be considered in some detail before we can grasp the full purport and extent of what is meant by the command of the sea.\"\"\""

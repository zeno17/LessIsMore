But the flame of youth was in him, the sure sense that he could conquer where others had miserably failed; and, like all virile young Americans, he had love of adventure, and zest for the unknown was in his blood. The glamour of Arizona lured him; the color of these great hills and mountains he had come to love captivated him from the first. It was as if a siren beckoned, and he had to follow.',\n",

The air was like golden wine, and she drank it in, bathed her soul in it, as though she could never find enough joy through these slow hours.

       " '\"And now, what you say? You all \\'appy, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"And planty more what I shall steal for you myself personal. Now zen, is all right? You \\'ave ze money, ze lady, everyzing.\" Surely there was nothing lacking, Lopez tried to make it plain, for complete happiness. There were no bars now in the path of content.',\n",
       " '\"And she love you?\" Lopez went on.',\n",
       " '\"And this is why you were so anxious to come here,\" she said, very low; yet everyone heard her statement. \"To dig around, and then, if you found oil, to try to buy this place! Oh, I thought better of you than that, Morgan! What a trick--what a dishonorable trick!\" She shuddered away from him. She almost hated him in this revealing moment.',\n",
       " '\"And we are free to go?\" Lucia cried, unbelieving.',\n",
       " '\"And we\\'re not all as discreet as you!\" Pell flung back. \"And now, if you don\\'t mind,\" he added insinuatingly, \"I\\'d like to talk to my wife--alone.\"',\n",
       " '\"And which is \\'e?\"',\n",
       " '\"And whose life you save!\" Lopez added.',\n",
       " '\"And why not, I\\'d like to know?\" Pell inquired. \"Who\\'s he, anyhow, and what difference does it make?\"',\n",
       " '\"And why not?\" the bandit asked. He was thoroughly weary of Gilbert\\'s dilly-dallying, so foreign to his own philosophy.',\n",
       " '\"And why not?\" was all her husband said. \"Hadn\\'t I a right to look for oil here? Suppose it was on the place?\"',\n",
       " '\"And why?\" he inquired.',\n",
       " '\"And yet you \\'ave divorce!\"',\n",
       " '\"And you ain\\'t going to rob him, after all?\" Uncle Henry piped up.',\n",
       " '\"And you ain\\'t got anything more to say, Jones?\" He watched him closely.',\n",
       " '\"And you didn\\'t like it?\" Angela persisted, moving her little stool even closer to him.',\n",
       " '\"And you don\\'t even get excited?\"',\n",
       " '\"And you have annoyed him in other ways.\"',\n",
       " '\"And you\\'d throw me, old and sick, a invalid, out into the streets?\" Uncle Henry whined. No one could get more pathos into his tones than Uncle Henry when he wanted to do so.',\n",
       " '\"And your equity?\" Pell pursued, businesslike enough now.',\n",
       " '\"Angela!\" cried the enraptured \"Red.\" He went over to her, grasped her around the waist, and led her to the window.',\n",
       " '\"Angely! Angely!\"',\n",
       " '\"Another ten thousand.\"',\n",
       " '\"Answer me: how much is it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Any stronger cord on the place anywhere?\" Gilbert looked around the room. Maybe one of the many Indian jugs contained a string. \"Red\" and he had a habit of putting any old thing in them.',\n",
       " '\"Anything but,\" the latter answered.',\n",
       " '\"As I say, no trouble for me,\" Lopez boyishly said, and smiled, shrugging his broad shoulders.',\n",
       " '\"As I was going to say--\" Hardy started, when Uncle Henry interrupted him with:',\n",
       " '\"As long as I get there by eight, what difference does that make?\" Pell asked.',\n",
       " '\"As though I should ever need reminding! How dull you men can be! But I don\\'t want to take them from you, Gil.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ask him about marryin\\'--you know. I gotter find out because Hardy\\'s comin\\'.\" No speech could have been plainer and balder. \"Did you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ask him!\" Uncle Henry said. \"An\\' I only hope to thunder he tells a lie!\" His voice went up on a high key.',\n",
       " '\"Ask who what?\" Lucia asked. She was not a little interested now. She came back into the room.',\n",
       " '\"Auction?\" Pell repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Aw, come on!\" poor \"Red\" begged.',\n",
       " '\"Aw, that\\'s all right,\" \"Red\" said. He didn\\'t like to be thanked, and he avoided even the shadow of sentimentality with Jones. After all, they were two young fellows, playing a big game together, taking big chances; and what was the use of talking about it? \"What are you going to tell the Pells?\" he suddenly asked, glad to get off the immediate subject.',\n",
       " '\"Azcooze, my general,\" he said. His chief turned. \"It is ze damn ranger. Zey is after us some more.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" Pell scornfully ejaculated.',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" cried Lopez. \"Zen I take her!\"',\n",
       " '\"Bah!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"Be off wid yez!\" she always began by saying. But the insinuating harmonica was his only reply; and she ended by begging him to come in and play for her while she messed with the pots and pans, and maybe found some batter for a plate of griddle cakes.',\n",
       " '\"Be off, now! Ye\\'ve got some travelin\\' to do before ye\\'re able to win Angela. Then ye can think of buyin\\' a ranch.\"',\n",
       " '\"Beautiful!\" Uncle Henry went on, repeating the word in derision. \"What\\'s beautiful about it? That\\'s what I\\'d like to know.\"',\n",
       " '\"Because I\\'ve heard that you kill people,\" she bravely told him.',\n",
       " '\"Because he ain\\'t talked of nothin\\' else for six months. You wasn\\'t thinkin\\' of doin\\' it, was you?\" He hung on Gilbert\\'s answer.',\n",
       " '\"Because she told me, that\\'s how! And if only the gol darn fool would do it like I want him to--\" He addressed himself suddenly to his nephew, who now stood on the other side of the table: \"Aw, come on. Be a good feller, won\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because the minute you begin to take life seriously, it takes you that way, and then--\"',\n",
       " '\"Because there was no decent hotel anywhere near. I couldn\\'t do less than offer them what little hospitality I had, could I, when Sturgis suggested it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because you \\'ave never really lived,\" the bandit explained. \"Because you \\'ave been always protect by ozzers. I kill only men. And only evil men. And when I kill evil man, it make me very \\'appy. For I \\'ave did a good deed.\" His simple philosophy pleased him.',\n",
       " '\"Blamed if I know, Angy! Thanks, Mrs. Quinn.\"',\n",
       " '\"Boo!\" came from Lucia softly. She laughed, and ran up the tiny stone stairs that led to her room.',\n",
       " '\"Boo, yourself!\" called out Uncle Henry, determined to have the last word, as Lucia disappeared. Then he turned querulously on his nephew, as soon as he was certain she was out of hearing. \"Why did you ever invite \\'em to stay here in the first place?\" he wanted to know. The sound of \"Red\\'s\" harmonica was heard outside.',\n",
       " '\"Bueno! We begin,\" said the bandit. He called through the door: \"Pedro! Bring zem all in again.\"',\n",
       " '\"Bueno. I go,\" said Lopez, and started toward the door. Then he turned to Gilbert. \"Astuavago adios. Maybe we will meet again, maybe no. Quien sabe?\" He waved his hand, gave one last look at Pell\\'s limp form, and cried, \"Adios!\" He was gone--vanished like a ghost.',\n",
       " '\"Bullet?\" asked Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"But I better make sure,\" said \"Red,\" kneeling beside the body. \"Right in the head. Not a chance.\" He was peering down at the gaunt face. \"No, not a chance when you get it there.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I can earn money,\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"But I do wish to live!\" Lucia cried in desperation; and her hands went out in an attitude of supplication.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t know that there\\'s oil here,\" Pell argued.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t see why--\" the unremitting Angela started to say.',\n",
       " '\"But I don\\'t understand ...\"',\n",
       " '\"But I left the foreman and the cook,\" Gilbert reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"But I want to see!\" cried Angela, dancing with excitement now.',\n",
       " '\"But I want to talk to you myself,\" the latter reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"But I was here first,\" Morgan Pell argued. He hated to be beaten by this stripling.',\n",
       " '\"But I\\'ve lost the place.\" He pointed to the little clock that was ticking out its relentless minutes. \"It\\'s after eight o\\'clock.\"',\n",
       " '\"But I--\" Hardy began.',\n",
       " '\"But I--\" Pell started to say.',\n",
       " '\"But I--must pay him back,\" Gilbert wanted to make it clear.',\n",
       " '\"But Mexico! How different!\" Lopez said, paying no more attention to Angela than he would to a fly.',\n",
       " '\"But don\\'t you see what it would mean to you, dear Gil? To have someone always here; to kiss you when you go; to greet you when you come back; to laugh with you when you are glad; and comfort you when things go wrong. To give you the sympathy, the understanding that a man finds only in a woman\\'s heart. Don\\'t you see, Gil?\"',\n",
       " '\"But he seems to be,\" said the shrewd Angela, looking at Morgan Pell with his wily countenance.',\n",
       " '\"But he want you. And so ...\"',\n",
       " '\"But he\\'s a fine young feller, if I do say so!\" Uncle Henry came to Gilbert\\'s rescue, after the manner of all relatives when an outsider steps in with criticism.',\n",
       " '\"But he\\'s my nevyer!\"',\n",
       " '\"But how could he have moved?\" \"Red\" exclaimed. \"He\\'s dead, I say!\"',\n",
       " '\"But how did you get ahead so fast?\" young Jones wanted to know. \"That\\'s what sticks me.\"',\n",
       " '\"But how? How do you work it?\" Gilbert inquired, his brain in a tumult.',\n",
       " '\"But if I should give you a gun, you might shoot me wiz it!\" Lopez laughed.',\n",
       " '\"But if you\\'ll--\" the old man pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"But if you\\'ve been raiding around here,\" Uncle Henry said from his seclusion, \"won\\'t the rangers be after you?\"',\n",
       " '\"But is it all right?\" the young man persisted.',\n",
       " '\"But it isn\\'t getting us anywhere--just to sit around and complain,\" his nephew tried to pacify him, rising, and starting toward him again; but Uncle Henry didn\\'t want to be so near him, knowing what he was going to say next. Therefore he switched adroitly to the door, and let out, \"No, it ain\\'t gettin\\' us anywhere; but it would if you\\'d marry Angela Hardy, like I want you to!\" He was a little frightened now that he had uttered the words, and he looked anxiously at Gilbert to see their effect. The latter remained as calm as ever. \"But I don\\'t love her,\" was all he said.',\n",
       " '\"But it seems so cold-blooded!\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"But it was what he done!\"',\n",
       " '\"But it won\\'t grow nothin\\'--not even rocks, an\\' you know it,\" the occupant of the wheel chair said. Then a new thought came to him, and he shot out, \"By golly, I got it! He\\'s an oil man, ain\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"But it\\'s legal!\" Pell fired back. \"And what do I care--what does anybody care--so long as it\\'s legal! Ha! the courts would be with me! Moreover, it\\'s the way you get the clothes you wear and the food you eat, and all those jewels that you hang on yourself when you undress and go to the opera!\"',\n",
       " '\"But officer--\" began Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"But she,\" went on Uncle Henry, just as if nothing had been said, and pointing to Lucia, \"is married to him,\" indicating Pell. \"Which makes it a hell of a mess all around!\" He leaned back in his chair as if he had done a good day\\'s work.',\n",
       " '\"But since to you gentlemen it seem so excitable--I \\'ave it.\"',\n",
       " '\"But that isn\\'t honest!\" Lucia fearlessly said. \"It\\'s as crooked as it can be! And you know it.\"',\n",
       " '\"But to kill a man--like that! In cold blood!\" Hardy gasped. \"Oh, it\\'s horrible!\"',\n",
       " '\"But we shall not talk of me,\" Lopez said. \"We shall spik of you. \\'Ow you been since I seen you, what?\" He tossed away his cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"But what in the world could anybody be taking specimens of the soil around here for?\" he inquired, and then began to think.',\n",

       " '\"By gollies, he\\'s got it again!\" Uncle Henry yelled, in desperation. He switched his chair around, and faced Gilbert. \"Why didn\\'t you tear it up while he was dead?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"By golly!\" \"Red\" exclaimed, on his knees, his hand on Pell\\'s white face.',\n",
       " '\"Can I? If you think not waving to you is cruelty, you ought to see some of my other forms of torture.\"',\n",
       " '\"Can\\'t stop,\" Bradley waved him aside. \"Now we gotter get him.\" He went out as swiftly as he had come in. Every instant was precious. There was not a second to be lost.',\n",
       " '\"Can\\'t you guess?\" asked \"Red,\" coming forward, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly I do,\" the other answered.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly I don\\'t believe it. My confidence in my wife is implicit.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not! I\\'m only twenty!\" She was swift with the denial.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not!\" Gilbert was instantly saying, and glared at his uncle. The latter, as usual, plunged straight ahead, as the others now gathered about the room. \"He,\" meaning \"Red,\" \"loves her. He,\" he nodded toward his nephew, \"loves her,\" pointing to Lucia Pell. \"And she loves him,\" nodding back to Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not!\" Uncle Henry went on. \"I got a gun here and I--\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not,\" Pell was quick to satisfy him. \"Only why didn\\'t you say so before?\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not,\" was the immediate reply.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly not. What are you raving about, anyhow? Cut out this sort of talk, Uncle. You\\'re getting on my nerves.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly wheels a mean chair,\" he said good-naturedly to Gilbert, as he watched Uncle Henry steer himself out to the gate. \"Got his cut-out open, too! Pesky to-day, ain\\'t he? That\\'s one reason I came back.\" He spread his legs apart, and fanned himself with his hat. He ran his fingers through his thick, violent crop of hair. \"A mean Arizona day!\" he said. \"The walk made me hot.\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly!\" said Angela, coming over to him. \"You\\'re a boob, \\'Red,\\' and if you don\\'t look out, there\\'s a fellow over at Bisbee who--\"',\n",
       " '\"Certainly. I must go and pack anyway.\" And she started toward the steps that led upstairs.',\n",
       " '\"Certainly; when I die,\" answered Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"Ciertamente no!\" the bandit said.',\n",
       " '\"Ciertamente!\" the bandit stated, as though they were talking of the weather. \"You capture ze preesoner. You \\'ave no jail to put \\'im in. You pack him around wiz you. If you let \\'im go, \\'e come back to fight you again. So you kill him. Eet is very simple.\"',\n",
       " '\"Come, \\'Red,\\'\" said the girl, as she started to follow her father. What else was there to do?',\n",
       " '\"Company, my dear sir,\" Pell quickly retorted, not a little annoyed at the question; and he glared at the old man. He had had two days of him, and was getting used to him. Lucia, who had remained silent by the door, saw the cloud on her husband\\'s face, and gave a little, startled \"Oh!\" It was hardly more than a whisper, but Pell was swift to catch it. He turned on her, and took in her radiant figure.',\n",
       " '\"Could not t\\'ink,\" Lopez insisted.',\n",
       " '\"Could not,\" the Mexican answered.',\n",
       " '\"Couldn\\'t sleep a wink,\" he said. \"This cursed heat, you know. Glad I don\\'t have to live in this part of the world all the time.\"',\n",
       " '\"Dad\\'s awfully hard about holding to a bargain,\" Angela reminded him. \"He\\'s all business. He wasn\\'t that way until after Ma died. I do wish he\\'d be more human. I\\'ve talked to him and talked to him, until I\\'m tired; but he\\'s getting harder all the time. This is the last day, isn\\'t it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Debommultalo!\" his henchman replied.',\n",
       " '\"Despues de la comida,\" said Pedro.',\n",
       " '\"Did I not tell you for kill zis man?\" said Lopez, pointing in disgust to Morgan Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Did you ask him?\" Uncle Henry went on, paying not the slightest heed to her surprised glance.',\n",
       " '\"Did you call me?\" she wanted to know, looking at all three.',\n",
       " '\"Dinner ought to be ready now,\" Gilbert answered patiently, never looking up from his paper.',\n",
       " '\"Dirt?\" Gilbert said, not understanding.',\n",
       " '\"Do not ask me.\" He caught sight of \"Red.\" \"Ze next is you.\" He appraised him rapidly, and then said to Gilbert, \"\\'E is frand for you, no?\"',\n",
       " '\"Do what?\" Angela pursued.',\n",
       " '\"Do what?\" Pell asked, jerking out the two words in a high staccato. He hated to be questioned, particularly by his wife. His hands reached for the satchel he had brought in.',\n",
       " '\"Do you mean to say you\\'re going to set here and get throwed out into the street and not even try to do something?\"',\n",
       " '\"Do you think I want my darter to marry a gol darn fool?\" Hardy fired back at the old man.',\n",
       " '\"Do you think they can hit him?\" Angela cried.',\n",
       " '\"Does he--does he love her?\" Lucia brought herself to ask.',\n",
       " '\"Does life mean as little to you as that?\" Lucia asked another question. This man was an enigma. He was bad through and through. They were as helpless as cattle in his hands.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t mind Uncle Henry,\" Gilbert said to Lucia. \"He\\'s got a heart of gold, but he can be cranky and eccentric sometimes. Maybe he\\'s got one of his moods to-day. I never know. Tomorrow he\\'ll be all right--perhaps. I hope so, anyhow.... But come inside. You must be tired after your trip. Your rooms are upstairs.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t remember!\" Uncle Henry yelled. \"But that\\'s what I left you here for! We had it all framed up! Why didn\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t shoot!\" cried the bandit. And he laughed outright, almost doubling up with mirth.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t worry,\" he reassured her, and patted her little hand, so warm on his arm. He turned to Pell. \"You city fellers needn\\'t think you can come down here and put it all over us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you call the United States a free country?\" Lucia asked him.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you know?\" he asked, and looked her straight in the eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you shush me, gol darn it!\" cried Uncle Henry, crumpling the newspaper in his hand and throwing it on the floor. The heat was affecting him. \"I\\'ve kep\\' still long enough, an\\'--\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t you suppose I do? Don\\'t you suppose I\\'ve always understood, ever since--\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t--don\\'t speak to me!\" Angela sniffed, and stamped her dainty foot. \"Don\\'t look at me! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you all!\" Blinded with rage and tears, she crossed the room, and stumbled directly into Uncle Henry\\'s chair, and all but tipped him over. \"Red\" followed her, solicitously.',\n",
       " '\"Drink?\" yelled Uncle Henry from his chair, frantic at the thought of any more of their precious liquor being consumed. It was hard enough to get, even when one had plenty of money.',\n",
       " '\"Drunk?\" Pell asked.',\n",
       " '\"Easier than a fellow in Bisbee--maybe. Better look out, \\'Red,\\' or I\\'ll sue Mrs. Quinn for alienation of affections!\"',\n",
       " '\"East?\" \"Red\" asked. He had seated himself at the table, and picked up Gilbert\\'s pen, and began making curious little scrawls with it on a piece of paper, as a business man sometimes does when he is telephoning.',\n",
       " '\"Easy!\" Gilbert repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Ees a prison for ze soul!\" Lopez affirmed. \"A stupid, seely place, your New York!\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees bum shooting! If she \\'appen some more, zen I \\'ave for get new Pedro. Should be too bad. Especially for you. You onnerstand?\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees idea what I get from ze moving pitchers.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees life too horrible?\" Pancho wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Ees no difference from us three--me, you, and \\'im,\" Lopez explained. \"You is afraid for kill. \\'E was afraid for die. Me, I am afraid for neizer! Now zen, what you do, eh?\" He patted Gilbert on the shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"Ees no way for pliz you. If I do not kill ze \\'usband, ees all wrong. If I do kill ze \\'usband, ees all wrong. Say,\" he looked at him in confusion, \"what ze \\'ell shall I do wiz ze damn \\'usband, anyway?\" He puckered his brow.',\n",
       " '\"Ees pretty old,\" laughed Lopez. \"Let me see your teeth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ees recipe,\" Lopez affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"Ees too bad,\" said Lopez, nonchalantly. \"But nozzing to get excite about.\"',\n",
       " '\"Eight o\\'clock to-night?\" his uncle cried, and leaned so far out of his chair that he was in danger of falling to the floor.',\n",
       " '\"Eight o\\'clock!\" Hardy cried. \"And the place belongs to me!\" He turned to Pell. \"Anything more from you?\" he inquired, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Enjoying? Ha! Suffering, I guess you mean!\" And Pell\\'s head went back and he gave out a guffaw.',\n",
       " '\"Even you?\" Gilbert inquired, puzzled.',\n",
       " '\"Ever since when, Gil? Then you have known such a woman?\"',\n",
       " '\"Everything?\" he said, significantly; and his eyes became two narrow slits as he looked at her.',\n",
       " '\"Exactly. Will you take it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Exemption?\" Gilbert repeated the word, a little angry at its utterance. This wasn\\'t like Uncle Henry who, with all his peculiarities, had always been a patriot.',\n",
       " '\"Fair?\" Lopez rolled the word over.',\n",
       " '\"Finished?\" asked Pell.',\n",
       " '\"First time I use a knife in long while!\" he laughed, as he stood up to the job. \"Now we all eat much; an\\' mebbe give some to leetle Pancho and Panchita too, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"First you won\\'t marry Hardy\\'s daughter and now you won\\'t ask him for money,\" Uncle Henry pursued the subject.',\n",
       " '\"For \\'im,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"For me New York can go to \\'ell just as soon as she damn please!\" the bandit let out.',\n",
       " '\"For me you name him?\" Lopez finally got out. \"Oh, too good you are to me. Pancho! my own leetle boy! Pancho! \\'Some\\' name, what you say, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"For me?\" cried Uncle Henry, joyfully.',\n",
       " '\"For the love of Mike, quit your babbling! Sssh!\"',\n",
       " '\"For why? It is not my habit. I give not a damn for any man.\" He snapped his fingers, as though at life itself.',\n",
       " '\"Fortunately for us, my dear,\" he said. \"For now we are certain not to be disturbed while working out a sensible solution of our little problem.\" He had forgotten the pain in his head. He lighted a cigarette, casually, slowly. \"You will of course sue for divorce,\" he went on, blowing a ring to the ceiling and watching it ascend. \"But there\\'ll be no difficulty about that. I shall not contest,\" he added magnanimously.',\n",
       " '\"Friend of yours?\" said Morgan Pell, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"From what my frand tell me, I can see now \\'ow you make your money,\" the bandit told Hardy. \"You are a robber.\"',\n",
       " '\"Gad!\" Pell let out. His hands went together, his jaw set. Things were coming out beautifully.',\n",
       " '\"Gee! you make a feller happy, Mrs. Quinn!\" said the appreciative \"Red,\" sitting down, and getting busy, \"Won\\'t you come to Bisbee with Angela an\\' me the next time we go to the movies?\"',\n",
       " '\"Geemoneddy!\" Uncle Henry broke the tension.',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" cried Lucia, in mortal terror.',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" she cried out; and anguish was hers--a deep, horrible moment of suffering. It was all up with them. They were as helpless as Pell had been with the bandit a few hours before. Caught, ensnared, trapped!',\n",
       " '\"Gil!\" she cried.',\n",
       " '\"Gil--\" the girl got out the first syllable of his name, and no more; for her little handkerchief was at her pretty nose.',\n",
       " '\"Give him his ranch back, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"Give me a gun, too!\" the fool prayed.',\n",
       " '\"Give me that water,\" Bradley continued. \"I want to get him in alive if I can. All the more credit to me and my men, you see.\"',\n",
       " '\"Give you a gun! Pedro!\" The man had evidently been just outside the door, and came in at once. \"Pedro, you \\'ear?\" And Pedro grinned.',\n",
       " '\"Glad?\" exclaimed Gilbert. \"I could kiss you, Pancho! But where on earth have you been? Come in, and tell us everything.\"',\n",
       " '\"Go on--you ask \\'em!\" suggested Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Go?\" he asked. \"What do you mean?\"',\n",
       " '\"Gol darn, the gol darn--\" cried Uncle Henry; and then he swerved on Jasper Hardy: \"Maybe you can persuade him,\" he suggested.',\n",
       " '\"Good Lord!\" was all Gilbert could utter.',\n",
       " '\"Good Lord!\" was all young Jones could say, and he put his hand to his head.',\n",
       " '\"Good afternoon, Mr. Pell,\" said old Smith to the newcomer.',\n",
       " '\"Good morning, Lucia,\" Gilbert said, hardly daring to look at her.',\n",
       " '\"Good!\" laughed Lopez. \"She is did.\"',\n",
       " '\"Good!\" smiled Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Gosh! ain\\'t it hot!\" finally came from Uncle Henry, his voice a drawl.',\n",
       " '\"Got any water?\" Bradley asked.',\n",
       " '\"Got it in the head, eh?\" the ranger went on, looking down at Pell, but with no pity in his face. He was too accustomed to death. A man who had been killed was just another \"case\" to him--one of an endless row of corpses.',\n",
       " '\"Got what?\" his nephew asked.',\n",
       " '\"Guess!\" said Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Gun?\"',\n",
       " '\"H\\'m!\" Lopez murmured. \"You have given me a idea.\" He rubbed his hands together, and then pushed his big sombrero a little back on his forehead. \"Better as my own. I shall use it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha! You\\'ve had your turn, my lady! Now, it\\'s mine! And after all I\\'ve done for you, you ungrateful hussy!\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha!\" The bandit saw his chance. \"Is it possible all ze law what you love is not so damn wise, after all?\" He was tickled at his own perspicacity. \"However, it makes no never mind. You shall still be rich any\\'ow. I shall send back all ze cattle what I steal from you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ha!\" laughed Lopez. \"If I am ever caught, I shall be \\'anged many times!\"',\n",
       " '\"Hallo, Oncle Hennery,\" he greeted the old man in the wheel chair. \"You look splendid! And \\'allo, \\'Red,\\'--zat\\'s what zey call you--yes?\" Then he saw the babies, and his eyes fairly popped from his head, \"Well, well!\" he cried, \"Who \\'ave zese leetle fellers!\"',\n",
       " '\"Hardly!\" with a smile.',\n",
       " '\"Has it gone off yet?\" she naïvely asked.',\n",
       " '\"Has it got a kick in it?\" the other wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Has what gone off?\" from Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Have a good nap?\" Gilbert inquired; but he really didn\\'t care at all. Pell, however, took his question seriously.',\n",
       " '\"Have you any objections?\" Pell said, curling his lip. The irony in his tone was unmistakable.',\n",
       " '\"Have you got the money?\"',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t got a drink, have you, while we\\'re waiting? Not that I need an appetizer! And it\\'s damned hot, I know, to guzzle whiskey.\"',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t you any laws in Mexico?\" Lucia inquired.',\n",
       " '\"Haven\\'t you heard? Lopez has broken off the reservation again.\"',\n",
       " '\"Having you here is all the thanks I want,\" he answered. He had everything snugly packed now.',\n",
       " '\"He certainly is,\" answered young Jones promptly. \"About the best I ever had.\" He wasn\\'t going to see anything happen to the faithful \"Red.\" He\\'d have protected him with his own life.',\n",
       " '\"He is my husband,\" Lucia then found herself saying. \"I am now Mrs. Pell.\"',\n",
       " '\"He means it, Gil!\" Lucia cried, and threw herself into her lover\\'s arms. She would die, if he died--she would die with him.',\n",
       " '\"He moved!\" cried Uncle Henry, excited now, and rising in his chair, which he wheeled out into the room.',\n",
       " '\"He says he can fix it,\" Uncle Henry said. \"Let him try. He\\'s done swell so far. Personally, I got a lot o\\' confidence in that feller. He\\'s slick, he is!\"',\n",
       " '\"He shall go free,\" Lopez announced.',\n",
       " '\"He takes it sort o\\' hard, don\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"He tries so hard to imitate you in everything. It makes me ache to see how happy he is, Gil. Aren\\'t they the cutest couple you ever saw? And won\\'t it be nice when Pancho and Panchita are old enough to play together?\"',\n",
       " '\"He wants to buy this ranch because there\\'s oil here!\" Uncle Henry went on, not dismayed in the least at the other\\'s insult.',\n",
       " '\"He won\\'t bother us,\" \"Red\" smiled, settling back again. \"Nothin\\' to steal here except the mortgage.\" He paused, as though in deep thought; but Gilbert, had he known it, was thinking even harder. Lopez, the Mexican bandit, was a dim uncertainty; the mortgage was a stern reality.',\n",
       " '\"He won\\'t?\" she finally said.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s dead, just as I say,\" Lopez stated. \"Pedro never misses.\"',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s down in the shed--fixin\\',\" the old man informed him.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s gone?\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s got a chance to make a swell marriage,\" announced Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s got him!\" came from Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s my uncle,\" young Jones answered.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s richer\\'n mud,\" Uncle Henry declared.',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s wounded,\" said Lucia, going to the door. \"You can\\'t take him--like that!\" she exclaimed. She longed for Lopez to turn and look at her; yet she longed, oddly enough, that he would not do so in the next second. It would be as difficult for her, as for him, if they saw each other. Her heart went out to him--this friend of Gilbert\\'s--and hers.',\n",
       " '\"He--he wants you to--to marry Angela Hardy, don\\'t he?\"',\n",
       " '\"Hello, Gil!\" she said, beating her riding-crop on her boot, and smiling that entrancing smile of hers. She was glad to see her handsome host again after her brisk ride.',\n",
       " '\"Help yourself,\" said Gilbert, not a little ashamed of the protest in Uncle Henry\\'s voice.',\n",
       " '\"Her!\" repeated Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Here they come!\" cried Angela, leaning out the doorway.',\n",
       " '\"Here\\'s your daddy, Pancho!\" she cried, when the car swung from the road, and Gilbert, hatless and sun-burned, leaped from the machine with all the eagerness of a great healthy boy.',\n",
       " '\"Here, sit ye down, \\'Red,\\'\" Mrs. Quinn ordered. \"But first see that yer feet is wiped off. I don\\'t want to see no dirt along me clean floor.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hey! Wait a minute.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hey! What the Sam Hill!\" and backed away; but not until he had dipped his hands into the bag.',\n",
       " '\"Hey! You can\\'t do that!\" wailed the invalid. He wheeled his chair toward his nephew. \"You wouldn\\'t do that if my friend Lopez was here, you big bum!\" he ended, as peevish as an infant.',\n",
       " '\"Hey, what\\'s comin\\' off?\" Had the darkness deceived him?',\n",
       " '\"His move!\" \"Red\" repeated the phrase. \"Say, you wouldn\\'t go and skin him out of the place all over again, would you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Hold on, there! You can\\'t do this.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hold up your hands!\" yelled the bandit, stepping over the threshold. And Pell\\'s hands went up, like magic, the spurs jangling to the floor.',\n",
       " '\"Hooray!\" the old man yelled, and would have risen in his chair could he have done so.',\n",
       " '\"Hooray!\" yelled Uncle Henry. \"That\\'s the boy! I knew you was like that. You\\'re all right!\" And he backed into the alcove, happier than he had been in a long time.',\n",
       " '\"Horses don\\'t know who they really belong to. So they are branded. There is no reason why women equally ignorant shouldn\\'t be similarly treated.\" Every word was measured, uttered with fearful distinctness. His hand shot behind him on the table, where \"Red\" had left his spurs. Lucia saw the swift movement.',\n",
       " '\"How are you, Smith?\" he said. \"Evenin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"How are you?\" the latter answered, with no show of interest.',\n",
       " '\"How can I, you--you--\" Gilbert could scarcely stand it any longer.',\n",
       " '\"How can anybody be nice about a thing like this?\" said the man of iron.',\n",
       " '\"How can he try any funny business?\" Gilbert asked.',\n",
       " '\"How dare you push my face, you bad man!\"',\n",
       " '\"How dare you! How dare you, I say! This is the crowning interference!\" He had put his hands behind his back and braced his shoulders, fearing that he would not be responsibile for what he did.',\n",
       " '\"How did you know?\" Jones asked.',\n",
       " '\"How do you know that?\"',\n",
       " '\"How much?\" Lopez asked, not noticing.',\n",
       " '\"How much?\" Uncle Henry asked.',\n",
       " '\"How would you like a little trip out West? You look peaked. Maybe it would set you up.\"',\n",
       " '\"How--long has he been here?\" Lucia wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"However, if you don\\'t think that offer fair, I\\'ll give you twenty thousand cash and assume the mortgages.\"',\n",
       " '\"Humph! An\\' what does ze \\'usband promise? An\\' \\'as \\'e kept \\'is promise?\" There was no reply. \"Is plain \\'e \\'as not. Zen why should you keep your word to \\'im, when \\'e \\'as broken \\'is word to you? Eh? Why do you not go before ze judge and \\'ave your promise broken? Why ees it ze custom of your country? Why? Why?\" He looked bewildered.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave kill many American citizens,\" replied Lopez, without the slightest compunction.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave know so for a long time.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave met mans which would not fight for zeir money,\" he said with great deliberation, his lip curled. \"I \\'ave met mans which would not fight for zeir lives. But I \\'ave never before met ze man which would not fight for \\'is woman.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave planty money. You mus\\' not worry, my frand. I give you ten sousand dollar which you can send back should you be so foolish.\"',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave,\" the bandit answered. \"You need not thank me. It was a great pleasure.\" Evidently he smiled; Lucia would not look up.',\n",
       " '\"I \\'ave. Most enjoyishly!\" said Lopez, lighting a cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t got any. You robbed me of it!\" the old man flamed back. \"Now I\\'ll mind yours for a change. Make a monkey out o\\' me, will you, gol darn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t neither!\" Smith replied, like a little boy.',\n",
       " '\"I ain\\'t!\"',\n",
       " '\"I am married,\" was the answer.',\n",
       " '\"I am no damn fool!\" the bandit cried. And he deliberately raised his gun again.',\n",
       " '\"I am not going to force you to marry \\'im. You are going to choose to marry \\'im.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am not!\" he denied. \"I\\'m a business man.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am sorry. Zere is no oil,\" the bandit informed him.',\n",
       " '\"I am--nearly,\" she laughed. \"I\\'m twenty-four, you know.\"',\n",
       " '\"I asked \\'em!\" the invalid whined.',\n",
       " '\"I asked you,\" went on Pell, a little disconcerted at having to repeat his question, \"if you own this ranch.\"',\n",
       " '\"I bid one hundred thousand dollars,\" Pell quickly cried.',\n",
       " '\"I can take care of her,\" Gilbert was quick in saying.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t do it,\" Gilbert stated, as if he were discussing going to the nearest town.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t remember,\" the hollow voice went on. He fell back on the floor. He was weak from the loss of blood. \"Red\" lifted him up, and helped him around the table to a chair.',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t stand such beauty, Morgan,\" she said at last. \"It takes something out of me. We\\'ll have to go on.\"',\n",
       " '\"I can\\'t think,\" said Gilbert, sitting down, one hand on his forehead. \"It\\'s all so strange, so confusing to me. The world seems to be rocking beneath my feet. What does it all mean--this life we live for so brief a time? What does anything mean?\"',\n",
       " '\"I certainly do,\" cried Uncle Henry, \"an\\', gol darn it, I\\'m a-goin\\' to! Rob me of ten thousand dollars, will you?\"',\n",
       " '\"I did not know zat even a dog could be so yellow,\" he said. Then he turned to Pedro. \"I do not \\'unt rabbits. You kill \\'im, Pedro.\" And he would not look again on the miserable specimen of a man that wallowed there on the floor.',\n",
       " '\"I didn\\'t find it so,\" young Jones said, and smiled in his dry way.',\n",
       " '\"I didn\\'t--then. The time was inopportune.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not lend,\" was the hard response. \"I take.\" And he turned away.',\n",
       " '\"I do not see ze coffee,\" Pancho said at last.',\n",
       " '\"I do not speak about ze law,\" Lopez followed him up. \"I am doing only what is fair. If I were you, I should be ashamed for myself! You love your country?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do!\" answered Lopez, quick as a flash, and wondering how she could have asked so stupid a question.',\n",
       " '\"I do,\" she answered, \"and he\\'s right.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do--in a way. Oh, let\\'s don\\'t go into all that again, Morgan. We\\'ve had it out so many times. What\\'s the use?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do--in a way.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do?\" said Angela, wide-eyed.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t care if it\\'s only varnish!\" cried Uncle Henry, his voice rising high and shrill. \"And you let him go and take the whole bottle!\" He pounded the arm of his chair, always his last resort.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t dare to, Lucia.\" His voice was low.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t either!\" Angela protested, speaking before \"Red\" had a chance.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know exactly,\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know how he could!\" Uncle Henry cried, \"but he did! Look at him!\" He could scarcely control himself now.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what I am. But I do know I was only too glad to take the gamble with you. An\\' I\\'ll take another one right now if you\\'ve got one to suggest.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what to say, Gil.\" She moved closer to him. \"I\\'ve had a wonderful time--you know that. I want to thank you for it. You\\'ve been awfully kind to us.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know what\\'s the matter. I haven\\'t thought much about eating.\" He was engrossed again in his papers.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know,\" the young man said. \"We\\'ve got to go somewhere.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know. I suppose--\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know. I--\" the foreman answered. Angela, frightened, followed the husky \"Red\" through the door; and the husband and wife were left entirely alone.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t mean to be ungrateful,\" Gilbert explained.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t mind business discussions. But there\\'s been too much insinuation to-day. I won\\'t have any more of it,\" Jones said.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t remember,\" was the disappointing answer.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t see how a woman as lovely as you can be so cold,\" he said. \"You could do anything with men.\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want him to marry her,\" the father was honest enough to say.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want to be made happy at a cost so great,\" Gilbert affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t want to kiss you.\" It was the refinement of cruelty. \"I want you to kiss me. Do it!\" His hands were behind his back. He stood straight and stiff as an Indian chief.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t wanter get shot,\" the old man declared.',\n",
       " '\"I get for you!\" the cook screamed in a shrill voice, and rushed for the kitchen.',\n",
       " '\"I get yer,\" said \"Red,\" visibly relieved.',\n",
       " '\"I got it!\" he all but yelled.',\n",
       " '\"I got them up especially, in honor of your visit,\" Jones said; and then he remembered how many times a remark like that must have been made, by many a lover, as if it were quite original, as if no one had ever thought of it before!',\n",
       " '\"I gotter stick by him,\" he said, looking at Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"I guess there\\'s no doubt about that. But it ought to be a guardian in my case; or maybe a keeper.\" She could see that he was stalling for time, and trying to laugh off a topic that was serious indeed to him.',\n",
       " '\"I guess they don\\'t grow any more. At least, not in this part of the country.\" He rose, a bit wearily, and walked over to the mantel-piece.',\n",
       " '\"I have so decide!\" the bandit stated.',\n",
       " '\"I have ze scouts who watch,\" the bandit said. He turned to Gilbert again. \"Suppose I stop here and prove to you who sink you have trouble, zat really you have no trouble at all?\"',\n",
       " '\"I have?\"',\n",
       " '\"I have?\" she wailed, terrified to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"I hope it\\'ll be soon!\" cried out Uncle Henry. Then, to \"Red,\" \"Don\\'t you see he\\'s leading you up to the top o\\' that gol darn mountain?\"',\n",
       " '\"I hoped to pick a fortune off a tree somewhere, and come back and surprise you with it. I was going to buy an automobile--one of those low ones as long as a Pullman car--and fill it with roses, and come dashing up to your front door and take you for a ride through the hills. It was to be autumn. I had even that fixed,\" he laughed. \"Oh, I had everything thought out! And you were going to be so proud of me!... But I couldn\\'t find a fortune-tree anywhere....\" He looked away, embarrassed. He hadn\\'t meant to tell her this.',\n",
       " '\"I knew there was a ketch in it!\" Uncle Henry said, and rolled back in the shadows of the alcove.',\n",
       " '\"I know I could be,\" Angela informed him.',\n",
       " '\"I know darn well he should!\"',\n",
       " '\"I know how he got mine, gol darn it!\" Uncle Henry cried. Hardy glared at him, seemed to smite him with his eyes.',\n",
       " '\"I know it,\" said Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"I know, I know!\" he cried. \"But once she gets her mind set on a thing--\"',\n",
       " '\"I know,\" said \"Red.\" Gilbert looked at him closely. \"I get yuh,\" the foreman continued. \"But I don\\'t like it just the same.\" He switched over to the malignant Pell. \"There\\'s one little detail I\\'d like to call your attention to,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"I know--I know,\" he said, and there was a shade of anguish in his voice. \"Forgive me. There shall be absolutely nothing said. Not even a gesture. I promise you that. It is as though we had never known each other.\"',\n",
       " '\"I missed you,\" Lucia answered, unashamed.',\n",
       " '\"I must make my frand \\'appy,\" the bandit said. Pedro gave the money to Uncle Henry. The latter grabbed it as a child might have grabbed a cooky.',\n",
       " '\"I never heard anybody complain,\" Gilbert smiled. \"After two or three of \\'em, I never saw anybody able to complain!\"',\n",
       " '\"I never knew life was like that!\" she said.',\n",
       " '\"I never thought I could love anybody so much!\" the girl replied. \"Oh, \\'Red\\'!\" And she hugged him again.',\n",
       " '\"I only hope he tells one!\" Uncle Henry couldn\\'t help saying, pointing to Hardy.',\n",
       " '\"I only want you to be nice about it, daddy,\" Angela persisted, sweetly.',\n",
       " '\"I pick from my men ze best rider. I make \\'im for look like me. So when ze ranger wish for chase me, \\'e go while I remain be\\'ind. It save me moch hexercise. Say, why you no kill \\'im yourself? You got ze gun.\" Lopez was mystified.',\n",
       " '\"I regret that I must insist,\" Gilbert said. And there was a duel of eyes, as well as of wits, before Jones turned away, easily the victor. After all, it was his own house, his own ranch. His visitor was wise enough to realize that. He walked over to the table and took the tequila bottle up again. \"I\\'ll have another drink, if you don\\'t mind,\" he said, to Gilbert\\'s back.',\n",
       " '\"I regret--that water--I gave away so liberally,\" Pell said, his voice weak.',\n",
       " '\"I remember, now,\" Pell murmured. \"The bandit.\"',\n",
       " '\"I rob ze bank,\" said Lopez; and thought nothing more of it.',\n",
       " '\"I say yes, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"I see what you mean! But I don\\'t agree,\" Pell pursued. \"This Jones person is nothing in my life. And why I should be deprived of my liquor and forced to eat burnt beans three times a day, I can\\'t see.\" He emitted a sound that might have been designated a laugh.',\n",
       " '\"I see,\" said Lopez. \"And wiz ze strange ideas of your country, it makes you feel bad.\"',\n",
       " '\"I seen him--I swear I seen him!\" Uncle Henry\\'s eyes were almost popping from his head. \"Why didn\\'t someone do something? Why didn\\'t they see what he saw? Oh, to be able to walk, and not sit forever like a dried mummy in this chair!',\n",
       " '\"I shall call you soon,\" Lopez said. \"Zen you shall see. Now go.\" He got between them, and affectionately directed them to the door.',\n",
       " '\"I shall give you ten sousand dollar,\" was the bandit\\'s surprising remark.',\n",
       " '\"I shall never understand ze American idea. I give you a gun, you say?\"',\n",
       " '\"I should enjoy it tremendous,\" Uncle Henry kept right on, and all but smacked his thin old lips.',\n",
       " '\"I should lend you ten sousand dollar?\" the bandit asked.',\n",
       " '\"I should think it would,\" Jones replied.',\n",
       " '\"I still have uncle,\" he reminded her.',\n",
       " '\"I swear to God!\" she contradicted him.',\n",
       " '\"I tell you one damn big lie,\" Lopez laughed. \"But \\'as she not a million dollar from ze \\'usband which I kill?\" He nodded toward Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"I think it\\'ll be ready soon, Uncle. Do be patient. I want to write.\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought I had done something to offend you,\" she said, standing very still, and looking far beyond him now, as though viewing their whole unhappy past. \"And it\\'s worried me even until this very day. I didn\\'t do anything to offend you, did I, Gil?\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought that was what husbands always did!\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought there might be--that\\'s all.\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought we were through with all that!\" he said. \"What\\'s the use of harping on it?\"',\n",
       " '\"I thought you loved it here?\" she said.',\n",
       " '\"I thought,\" Pell brought out reluctantly, \"I thought there might be--oil on it.\"',\n",
       " '\"I used to have; but it cost me too much money,\" was Hardy\\'s explanation and vindication. \"Sentiment? Bosh!\" And he made a gesture of deep disgust.',\n",
       " '\"I want his ranch, not him,\" Hardy went on. He might have been discussing someone not in the room.',\n",
       " '\"I want it,\" was the other\\'s immediate reply.',\n",
       " '\"I was afraid you wasn\\'t,\" ventured Uncle Henry; and there was an awkward pause. Then, \"It\\'s pretty hot,\" the invalid remarked, delighted that no one had called him to account for his obvious insult. He knew he had all the advantage of a weak woman. His little throne was immune from attack.',\n",
       " '\"I was broke, and I--\" he managed to explain.',\n",
       " '\"I was detained by force,\" Hardy said.',\n",
       " '\"I was eighteen when you went away. And that\\'s nearly six years ago. Time flies, doesn\\'t it?\" She smiled at her bromidic remark, and sat down; but he did not reply, \"Gil,\" she said at last. He looked up. \"Why didn\\'t you come to see me before I went away?\"',\n",
       " '\"I was going to,\" the other replied, not even casting a glance over his shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"I was in Washington,\" Pell winced. \"A dollar-a-year man.\"',\n",
       " '\"I was waiting for some good news to tell you. I felt you would consider me a failure--a rank failure. I couldn\\'t have stood that. Women don\\'t know how proud men are about that.\"',\n",
       " '\"I was,\" laughed the other. \"I mean--only a scalp wound.\" And he pointed to the mark on his forehead.',\n",
       " '\"I will make for you!\" cried the wretched cook, opening his eyes, and so relieved to be still alive that he could scarcely articulate.',\n",
       " '\"I will! I warn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"I will--if I must!\"',\n",
       " '\"I wish you wouldn\\'t do that.\"',\n",
       " '\"I won\\'t neither cut nothin\\' out! An\\' you make me sick too, you gol darn fool!\"',\n",
       " '\"I would look at you,\" the bandit replied. He was appraising her already. \"Turn around.\" She obeyed, like an automaton, \"\\'Ow old are you?\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'d like to remark,\" \"Red\" went on, \"that if we ever gets into the cow business again, we ought to get us a nice ranch in Washington, D.C. It don\\'t pay American citizens to go too fur away from home, these days.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll be cussed if I will!\" the invalid cried. He clapped his hands over his vest pocket, where the money was safely hidden.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll make it one hundred and one!\" Hardy cried.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll make you love me,\" he told her, with all the ardor he could put into his voice. Few women can withstand that age-old phrase.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll put him up in Bisbee till I get a chance to ship him back to Bangor. He likes Bangor, you know!\" Gilbert smiled.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll see about it now,\" Jones promised.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll take it to the courts,\" Hardy contended.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll try,\" said the accommodating \"Red.\" \"You\\'re a good friend, Mrs. Quinn. I won\\'t forget you when I own this place!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m a plain man, and I don\\'t believe in beating about the bush. Get that through your head--every one of you, I mean.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m a tough little feller myself, sometimes. And if anything should happen that shouldn\\'t, I\\'ll be waitin\\' for you in town with a one-way ticket. And it won\\'t be to New York. Savez?\" Then he turned to his adored and adoring Angela. \"Come, Angy!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m afraid you\\'re right,\" Gilbert said. \"I was afraid it would be inevitable. I couldn\\'t have hoped for anything else.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m an American citizen!\" shrilled Pell.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m damned if you do!\" cried Gilbert. \"All day you\\'ve been trying to make me do things your way. I\\'ve had enough. This Mexican stuff may be all right in your country, but it won\\'t go here!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m for that,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m giving up this ranch,\" he told her, \"I shan\\'t want them any more. Please take them, for my sake.\" He made a gesture, as though they were the last of his poor possessions.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m glad we happened to meet again. Though it does seem strange, doesn\\'t it, that we should run across each other after all these years!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to do what I once saw another sensible husband do under these circumstances.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to have this thing out,\" he said. \"You can never go back to him now.\" There was finality in his voice.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m going to tell them I\\'m going away--important business.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m in Wall Street,\" Pell said, in a low voice. What in God\\'s name was this bandit going to do? What was his game?',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m in bad,\" he told her. \"Got to give the old place up. But what\\'s that to you?\" There was a sound behind them. \"Here comes Uncle Henry!\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not in business for my health,\" he said coldly.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m not to blame because he\\'s a rotten business man, am I?\" Hardy tried to set himself right.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m so glad, Gil. But you haven\\'t answered my question yet.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry, I had a lot of things to attend to. I\\'m glad you\\'re back, for I was beginning to be worried about you, Lucia. Bandits! They\\'re around again.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" Gilbert returned. \"I forgot all about you for the moment. Oh,\" he suddenly remembered that Hardy and Pell were unacquainted, \"you two gentlemen ought to know each other. Mr. Pell, shake hands with Mr. Hardy.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" Jasper Hardy announced; but did not mean it.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said Gilbert, gallantly, going to her. \"Please don\\'t feel badly about it.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said his host.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" was all Gilbert could get out.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry,\" was all Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry. What more can one say? If I--\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sure it is!\" the girl said.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m terribly sorry,\" he apologized, \"to have to tell you that dinner will be late.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m--married.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ve got something to say,\" he announced like an oracle. \"Your daughter wants to marry him!\" He imagined this would prove a thunderbolt; but Hardy calmly asked:',\n",
       " '\"I--I couldn\\'t,\" Gilbert answered.',\n",
       " '\"I--I--\" the latter stammered; but could get no farther.',\n",
       " '\"I--er--yes. Why?\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"I?\" said Gilbert. He smiled a little, and looked significantly about the room.',\n",
       " '\"If I get this place, I\\'m willing to give him a good bonus,\" Hardy continued.',\n",
       " '\"If I was always nice to you, you wouldn\\'t know how lucky you are!\" she countered. \"It\\'s good for you to have your bad days--with me.\"',\n",
       " '\"If he pays me before eight o\\'clock,\" the other replied promptly.',\n",
       " '\"If she is all right by and bye, why the \\'ell is she all wrong now?\" cried Lopez, incensed.',\n",
       " '\"If that\\'s all, I\\'ll give her a divorce!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you do that,\" said the other, \"they\\'ll have to tie me down to keep me from kissing you!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you don\\'t look out, you\\'ll be dancin\\' soon!\" \"Red\" used to say on these happy occasions. \"You can shimmy now!\"',\n",
       " '\"If you want money,\" he finally got out, \"for heaven\\'s sake, tell me how much, and ...\"',\n",
       " '\"If you wish,\" Lopez said, indifferently. It mattered little to him now who waited upon him. His inner man had been partially satisfied. He leaned back in his chair, at peace with all the world. One spurred and booted foot was on the table.',\n",
       " '\"If you\\'ll excuse me?\"',\n",
       " '\"In Mexico you would now be married five years--\" the bandit explained.',\n",
       " '\"In a way.\"',\n",
       " '\"In one half hour your trouble go poof!\" He made a ring of smoke and watched it fade away. \"And you shall be \\'appy man. If I do zat, what zen?\"',\n",
       " '\"In the arroyo,\" \"Red\" replied. He was at the window, looking out. \"You\\'ll see \\'em in a minute.\"',\n",
       " '\"In the gallopin\\' wash-boiler?\" \"Red\" smiled, \"That still belongs to us--I mean, you.\" He clinked his spurs on the table.',\n",
       " '\"Indeed it does, Lucia. I\\'ve often watched that sky until I\\'ve forgotten all about my cattle--both of them!\" He laughed, and reached for the twine. He was always turning their serious moments into a jest. As long as she had been here with her husband, he kept at a distance.',\n",
       " '\"Inside, I think, lying down,\" Gilbert replied, nodding toward the alcove, his pen rushing across the page.',\n",
       " '\"Is there anyone else?\" he asked. \"If I thought there was....\" He lifted his glass again.',\n",
       " '\"Is there anything I can do for you?\" Lucia asked, sympathy in her tone. Always with her was the womanly instinct to serve, to help. Morgan was like a wounded animal to her, and as deserving of attention as any hurt thing.',\n",
       " '\"It ain\\'t a he--it\\'s a she, I told you!\" Angela corrected.',\n",
       " '\"It ain\\'t my fault, Angela,\" the foreman assured her. \"I didn\\'t know he was going to do this! You know that.\"',\n",
       " '\"It couldn\\'t be! It couldn\\'t be!\" Angela declared. \"Anyone so romantic as you, so--\" And she tried to look her pleasantest. He must be placated, this wretched man.',\n",
       " '\"It does,\" Gilbert explained. \"You see, it isn\\'t eight o\\'clock yet.\" A faint smile came to his lips.',\n",
       " '\"It is Gil\\'s, and to take advantage of him isn\\'t fair. You know it as well as I do, too!\" She stamped her little foot.',\n",
       " '\"It is a good deed,\" said Lopez, turning. \"He was evil man.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is for you to keep zat word as I keep mine,\" Lopez said. Then, to Uncle Henry he went on, \"I shall start wiz you. Now, Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is in her eyes--and yours,\" the Mexican stated. \"I shall miss her. She is very beautiful. However, what is one woman between frands?\" He laughed a bitter laugh. \"You shall have her.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is not what you want,\" a new tone came into Lopez\\'s voice. \"It is what I want. I am ze law, \\'ere!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is not zat we want money,\" the bandit replied. \"It is zat we don\\'t want you.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is quite to be seen zat you are,\" the bandit grinned. \"Zis, if I may speak so, \\'as been a lucky day for me!\"',\n",
       " '\"It is you! Don\\'t you know me?\" He faced him squarely, threw back his shoulders, and waited, breathless, for his look of recognition.',\n",
       " '\"It is ze ranger what chase me some more again,\" smiled Lopez. He seemed wholly unconcerned.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t ready yet,\" Gilbert informed him. Lucia took advantage of her husband\\'s question to move over toward the door.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t ready yet,\" Jones answered. He disliked the other\\'s tone. After all, he was a guest in his, Gilbert\\'s, house. He hoped their wretched business would soon be settled, and Pell return to New York. He had had his fill of him.',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t what I wish,\" Jones answered. \"Nothing is what I wish.\"',\n",
       " '\"It isn\\'t zeir fault, too, is it?\" Lopez was curious to know.',\n",
       " '\"It makes me sick!\" was the unexpected reply.',\n",
       " '\"It shall be but a moment,\" the bandit promised. Gilbert walked to the fireplace so that his face would not be seen. Lopez went over to Lucia. \"Señora, you do not wish to speak of love. Why?\"',\n",
       " '\"It shall cost me planty money. I could \\'ave tooken you wiz me for ransom--\\'elluva big ransom--a million dollar, mebbe. But I am not soddid!\" He laughed, and rubbed his hands together.',\n",
       " '\"It was a trick?\" Gilbert asked, beginning to see light.',\n",
       " '\"It was only a flesh wound,\" \"Red\" said. \"The bullet just grazed his head.\"',\n",
       " '\"It was only pride?\" she was anxious to know again. \"Because you were poor! Gil! Did you think so little of me as that?\" There was a half-sob in her voice.',\n",
       " '\"It was paid me for a debt,\" the old man said.',\n",
       " '\"It was pride, I suppose,\" he went on.',\n",
       " '\"It was stolen from me first,\" Morgan Pell stated, calmly. \"Come across.\" He put one hand out. The other still held the cloth to his wounded forehead.',\n",
       " '\"It will?\" asked the incredulous \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"It would take too long to tell you.\" Hardy considered the argument closed; but Uncle Henry came right back again:',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s Pancho Lopez!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a Mexican drink.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a fair proposition, and, as far as I can see, your only way out, Jones.\" He had paid no attention to the old man\\'s interruption. But the latter broke in once more:',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s all right, Lucia,\" Gilbert said, and she went upstairs, almost weeping. Then he whirled about and glared at his uncle. \"It\\'s a good thing--no, I don\\'t know what I\\'m saying. You\\'re an invalid, or I\\'d strike you, despite your years, Uncle Henry. For heaven\\'s sake, can\\'t you learn to mind your own business?\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s all right,\" the foreman said. \"He ain\\'t got anything to lose anyhow. I\\'ll show you where he is,\" and, followed by the sinister Venustiano, he went out.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s always pretty hot till night--then it\\'s pretty cold,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s because they\\'re better looking than me,\" her slave went right on. \"I\\'m the one for you to marry, Angy, and you know it!\" He had faith in himself at last--she couldn\\'t stop him now.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s darn near night,\" Uncle Henry rasped.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s eight o\\'clock!\" \"Red\" exclaimed on the last peal of the bell.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s full o\\' dirt! Just dirt!\" Uncle Henry cried, and glanced about to see the effect of his surprising information.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s his--Gilbert Jones\\'s,\" cried \"Red,\" \"and I ain\\'t goin\\' to be party to robbin\\' him of it!\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s just that he doesn\\'t know any better,\" Angela went on to Gilbert. \"He\\'s really very neighborly when he wants to be.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s no use,\" Hardy broke in. \"You\\'re too late.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s only tequila,\" Gilbert tried to pacify him.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s poison!\" Pell cried. And as if he really believed it, and as though water were an antidote, he grabbed the water-bottle and drank from it swiftly and loudly. It was horrible the way he guzzled the liquid down. An animal would have done better.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s the law,\" Lucia told him.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s too horrible!\" said Lucia; and she turned away.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s too near the border,\" Jones answered. \"The bandits come over and steal all your cattle. It\\'s a rotten situation. I\\'m sorry I ever came down here.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s your life or his, and I\\'m damned if it\\'s yours! I\\'ll give you just three seconds to get out of here! Now,\" and there was a fire in his eyes that could deceive no one, \"you hear me? One--two ...\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s your reputation, of course,\" Pell smiled. \"You can do as you like with it.\" He turned fully toward her. \"All right, I\\'ve no objection.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s--it\\'s wrong!\"',\n",
       " '\"John Alden spoke for Miles Standish, an\\' they wasn\\'t even related,\" Uncle Henry tried to placate the other.',\n",
       " '\"Joking?\"',\n",
       " '\"Jones!\" Lucia said.',\n",
       " '\"Just like her, eh?\" said \"Red.\" \"What would we do without Mrs. Quinn, the queen of \\'em all!\"',\n",
       " '\"Just to show the character of the ground, to see what will grow best,\" Pell hastened to explain.',\n",
       " '\"Keep still!\" he warned him, and shook his finger in his face, \"Keep still, I say!\" His cheeks were scarlet with rage. The blood pounded in his veins.',\n",
       " '\"Keep still!\" the girl cried. \"Keep still! I think you\\'re dreadful!\"',\n",
       " '\"Kill me?\" he repeated, his head on one side, like a bird listening, and pointing to his chest.',\n",
       " '\"Kiss me!\"',\n",
       " '\"Let her what?\" A pair of steely eyes were fixed on the questioner.',\n",
       " '\"Let him examine them, then,\" suggested Pell, holding the satchel out to Gilbert, who stood on the other side of the table.',\n",
       " '\"Life \\'as been unkind to you. Too long \\'ave you been marry wiz ze tired business man. You shall come wiz me to ze land of purple mountains, where I will love you myself personal.\"',\n",
       " '\"Life?\" Lopez smiled. \"To be \\'ere--zat is life. Not to be \\'ere--\" he gulped down some steaming coffee--\"zat is death. Life is a leetle thing--unless it is one\\'s own.\" He put the big cup down and put in four spoonfuls of sugar, stirred it diligently, and looked around him, the wonder of a child in his face.',\n",
       " '\"Like \\'ell! You love yourself!\" And Lopez deliberately turned his back on him.',\n",
       " '\"Like it? It makes me seeck! Even beautiful woman what I see \\'ave \\'osband what is afraid for \\'er. Each time I get dronk comes big policeman which \\'it me on ze \\'ead.\" He smiled at the thought, \"When I go to ze teatro, ees someone which \\'ide under--ze bed. Not even can I step on ze grass because--New York! It crush ze \\'eart!\" He put both hands over his chest, and looked up at the ceiling.',\n",
       " '\"Like ze tub!\" said Lopez, inexorably, spreading his arms to indicate an immense diameter.',\n",
       " '\"Listen, \\'Red,\\'\" said Jones, in sympathy with the lad, and hoping to cover up his confusion. \"If Hardy comes, keep him out till I\\'m alone. I don\\'t want any war talk before the Pells.\"',\n",
       " '\"Look at mine!\" the proud Lucia couldn\\'t help saying. \"Isn\\'t he the image of his father?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here, there must be some way to settle this thing.\" But he had grave fears.',\n",
       " '\"Look here, you\\'ve kept me waiting too long. What does this mean, eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" Gilbert stepped in and said. \"You\\'re getting your money! What are you boiling about?\"',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" he said, \"that\\'s my wife you\\'re talking to!\" Rage was in his face. He didn\\'t care whether he was this man\\'s prisoner or not. There should be no insults hurled at Lucia--that old, primitive feeling for his woman was roused.',\n",
       " '\"Look here,\" he suggested, in a direct attack, \"can\\'t we settle things some way?\"',\n",
       " '\"Looks that way,\" the other replied. In their misfortune they were curiously united.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez! Lopez captured!\" There were tears in her eyes.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez!\" Pell exclaimed.',\n",
       " '\"Lopez!\" exclaimed \"Red,\" forgetting his pipe, his dinner, and even Angela for the moment. \"The devil he has!\"',\n",
       " '\"Lucia.\" \"Lucia!\" he rolled the name over on his tongue, and smiled. \"Lucia!\" he repeated. \"Ees nice name.\" Then, \"Come \\'ere. Come \\'ere!\" He did not wait for her to move this time. He put out his hand and drew her close to him. \"I would see more of you,\" he told her. And, to her amazement and horror, he lifted her skirt delicately, almost tenderly. Her womanhood revolted at his action. This barbarian! She slapped his hand. But Lopez paid no more attention to the blow than if a child had struck him. \"Not bad,\" he went on, indifferently, referring to her well-turned ankle. \"\\'Ow you like to go wiz me to Mexico? Well?\" when she did not answer. \"You \\'eard what I said.\"',\n",
       " '\"Marry him. Won\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe Lopez didn\\'t kill him after all,\" \"Red\" said, and knelt down to examine Pell\\'s body again.',\n",
       " '\"Maybe it\\'s because he hasn\\'t a lot of money. He may be honest in that.\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe sometime. By and bye; but not now.\"',\n",
       " '\"Maybe we don\\'t--and maybe we do, Gil.\" She went closer to him. \"Why don\\'t you marry?\" she dared to inquire.',\n",
       " '\"Maybe.\" She was teasing him, but he didn\\'t know it. \"Who were they?\"',\n",
       " '\"Me?\" said Lopez in surprise, \"It is not me, ees my double!\"',\n",
       " '\"Mexicans!\" he cried. \"What can they be doing here, now?\" His mind rushed back to that terrible evening so long ago when Lopez had ridden up to the adobe, and changed the world for them all in almost the twinkling of an eye.',\n",
       " '\"Millions!\" The word caught Uncle Henry\\'s fancy and imagination. He rolled it over on his tongue again and again. \"Millions!\" He babbled it, he played with it. \"Millions!\"',\n",
       " '\"Money, of course! That feller Pell, I mean. He\\'s rich, an\\' if he knowed that you and his wife was old friends--I betcher he\\'d lend you some.\" He paused, breathless, for he had run his sentences into one. Gilbert glared at him, as if he thought he had gone stark mad. But Uncle Henry was not afraid. \"You won\\'t ask him?\" he inquired.',\n",
       " '\"More than that. I want you to have them--to remind you--sometimes of--\" He broke off, like a frightened lad.',\n",
       " '\"Moved!\" cried \"Red.\" \"You\\'re crazy! He\\'s stone dead, if ever anyone was.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mrs. Quinn sent over the cake,\" Lucia announced, as the table-boy brought in a huge dish, on which was a chocolate cake of magnificent proportions. It looked--and was--as light as a feather; a work of art to be proud of.',\n",
       " '\"Much obliged,\" the ranger thanked him, nothing loath. \"Come on, Bloke. Good-night. We got him!\"',\n",
       " '\"My Gawd,\" the invalid fairly shrieked, \"all you gotter do is look at \\'em! I been watchin\\' \\'em ever since you came.\"',\n",
       " '\"My God!\" ejaculated Uncle Henry, furious at Angela\\'s accident, which so directly concerned himself, \"but everybody\\'s unreasonable to-day!\" He turned harshly on his nephew. \"You make me sick, you! Here am I doing my gol darndest to save the mess you\\'ve made, and you won\\'t even--\" He broke off, unable, in his wrath, to continue. His eye lit on Hardy. \"Look here,\" he cried, in desperation, \"ain\\'t there no way out of this thing? It was my money that bought this ranch, you know. And everybody knows it! The last ten thousand dollars I had in the world!\" There was a sob in his voice on the last words.',\n",
       " '\"My nevyer,\" the invalid said.',\n",
       " '\"My teeth!\" echoed Lucia. Did he take her for a horse?',\n",
       " '\"My! what a rotten life you \\'ave led!\" the bandit commiserated her. \"But ees not too late. I shall steel save you. But you shall not sank me. Shall not be so damn bad for me, too!\"',\n",
       " '\"Never no life? Never no fun? Ha! If you was old, fat--zen, perhaps. But young, beautiful! For why was you born if you no wish to leeve?\"',\n",
       " '\"Never! Never! Never!\" she screamed, and stamped her foot vigorously.',\n",
       " '\"Nevertheless,\" said Morgan Pell, \"I\\'ll just bid a hundred and seventy-five thousand.\"',\n",
       " '\"No grub yet?\" \"Red\" ventured. He was hungry even yet. Twenty-two is always hungry.',\n",
       " '\"No more than you loved any of the rest of \\'em,\" \"Red\" went on.',\n",
       " '\"No more\\'n a rattlesnake,\" Uncle Henry leaned out of his chair to whisper in a voice that could be heard by everyone.',\n",
       " '\"No wood alcohol?\" suspiciously. Pell was always looking out for himself.',\n",
       " '\"No! Don\\'t! I can\\'t--\"',\n",
       " '\"No! I am not cross wiz you! Eez zat you annoy me!\" And as though she were a doll, he pushed her from him, his big hand almost blotting out her pretty little face. The stool and Angela fell to the floor. She was furious. The devil in her was roused. Chagrined, she picked herself up. Her dainty plaid frock was covered with dust. She brushed it off as best she could, and cried:',\n",
       " '\"No!\" Angela contradicted.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" Lucia managed to say.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" came the gruff voice of Lopez. \"You!\" pointing to the frightened Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"No!\" she screamed, \"Oh, no, Morgan, not that!\" Her senses reeled. The earth crashed beneath her.',\n",
       " '\"No, I can\\'t,\" Uncle Henry was swift to deny. \"My smeller\\'s no good.\" He sniffed comically--as if that proved his point.',\n",
       " '\"No, I never can,\" Lucia agreed. And there was finality in her voice, too. It was as if Destiny had come into this house, and an unheard voice told them what to do.',\n",
       " '\"No, I wouldn\\'t!\" Uncle Henry protested. \"I--\" He quickly put his hand to his mouth, stopping it like a child caught in a lie. \"I mean--yes, I wouldn\\'t! Only we ain\\'t found the oil yet. And personally, I don\\'t believe there\\'s any here in the first place!\" Realizing what he had said, he caught himself again. \"I mean, it may be here, but--Don\\'t shoot yet! I\\'ll get it in a minute!\" he begged. He was agitated to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"No, Ooncle Hennery,\" the bandit laughed, \"she is yours for keeps. Zat is all. You may go!\" And he waved him out. \"And you,\" to Hardy. \"Pedro, show zem into ze open space!\"',\n",
       " '\"No, damn you!\" Pell in his rage cried out. \"But I\\'m going to, the first min--\"',\n",
       " '\"No, gratias; zat\\'s for peon. Zese from ze swell hotel National an Torreon--zay are good. I steal zem myself,\" pulling out his case and lighting another. He pushed his chair so that he could see young Jones better. \"Well, old frand, how you feel zis long time? Eh?\"',\n",
       " '\"No, not till eight o\\'clock,\" Gilbert\\'s passionless manner was maddening.',\n",
       " '\"No, sir,\" sitting up straight in his chair.',\n",
       " '\"No, thank you,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"No, thanks,\" Hardy said; but',\n",
       " '\"No, worse luck!\" Uncle Henry said.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" cried Lucia.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said Gilbert. \"This is something I\\'ve got to settle alone. But I thank you, \\'Red\\'--I thank you with all my heart. You\\'re a brick--a red brick.\" He smiled and patted him on the back.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said Lopez, definitely. \"For at \\'alf-past six-thirty, what I do? I tell you. When I am chase by ze ranger what I follow, I sink for myself eight o\\'clock she soon come. Suppose moggidge of my frands he meet wiz accident? Would never do!\" He waved his arms. \"So I goes and pays \\'er myself!\" He handed Gilbert a paper.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" said his employer.',\n",
       " '\"No,\" she said. \"And I\\'ve always wanted to go.\"',\n",
       " '\"No,\" was the laconic reply.',\n",
       " '\"No--the gol darn fool!\" the old fellow screamed again.',\n",
       " '\"No. But ees more to be did zan I \\'ave sought. But I \\'ave promise I shall make you a \\'appy man, my frand,\" again to Gilbert. \"Bueno! I keep zat promise. You have gave me your word zat you will not interfere. Is it not so?\"',\n",
       " '\"No. I mean can\\'t--just what I said. It wouldn\\'t be fair to her. I can\\'t pretend to love her when I don\\'t.\"',\n",
       " '\"No. West,\" answered Jones. \"They\\'re going East.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\" Morgan Pell shot out the word, and clenched his fists. The situation was becoming hot. This old fellow would have them all dead in a few moments if he didn\\'t keep his mouth shut.',\n",
       " '\"No.\" The monosyllable was more emphatic than any long explanation could have been. A scowl on his brow, Hardy came close to Lopez, fearlessly. \"I came to foreclose a mortgage I hold on this place. That is all.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\" There was profound contempt in the little word. \"He give up \\'is business to go away to fight to save you, while you stay be\\'ind to rob \\'im. Is zat fair?\"',\n",
       " '\"No; I\\'d let you wheel yourself out,\" Jasper Hardy, again the literal-minded Hardy, said. It was one of the meanest remarks that even he had ever made.',\n",
       " '\"No; I\\'ll get it, thanks. You see if you can\\'t prod up the cook a little. I\\'m hungry now.\"',\n",
       " '\"No; only mussels. Good ones, too.\"',\n",
       " '\"No? You \\'ave been married all your life wiz one man?\"',\n",
       " '\"No?\" the bandit asked.',\n",
       " '\"None of your business!\" was the instant answer.',\n",
       " '\"Nor for anybody else\\'s,\" Uncle Henry, unabashed, told him.',\n",
       " '\"Not afraid of bandits?\" he laughed, sipping his champagne. \"It\\'s right next door to Mexico, you know. Have some swell times down there, they say.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not as rich as yourn, of course,\" Uncle Henry pursued; \"but rich for him--and he won\\'t do it.\" He waited for her to say something; but she did not speak. There was a pause. Lucia looked out at the baking valley, and off to the far mountains, and the ticking of the clock could be heard like steady rain in a cistern. Then she went over to the table near the alcove, where a few books were scattered about. She opened one, and pretended to read. All the time Uncle Henry\\'s eyes never left her. And she knew he was searching her thoughts.',\n",
       " '\"Not at all. Señor Jones \\'ave been away to war. He been away fighting for \\'is country.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not for a million dollars!\" Lopez smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Not if I got there by eight o\\'clock,\" Pell said.',\n",
       " '\"Not like this.\" Lucia thought if he didn\\'t stop soon, she would shriek.',\n",
       " '\"Not me!\" Uncle Henry persisted. \"I\\'ve gotter tell the truth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not quite,\" said Gilbert. He stepped forward a pace or two. He saw that Lucia was alarmed. \"Come,\" he begged of her. \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Oh, the balm of those few words!',\n",
       " '\"Not really trouble.\" He came over and put his hand on Gilbert\\'s shoulder. \"Only trouble you are made for yourself because you go by law what are foolish instead of sense what are wise.\" He gave him an affectionate pat. Just then Uncle Henry wheeled himself in, neither inquiring nor caring if he was wanted or not.',\n",
       " '\"Not till after dinner,\" and puffed his cigarette.',\n",
       " '\"Nothin\\'. He\\'d better not. It\\'s the way he treats his wife. She\\'s so darn game, too. I wouldn\\'t treat a horse the way he treats her. Well, what are you goin\\' to tell them?\"',\n",
       " '\"Nothing of general interest.\"',\n",
       " '\"Nothing. You know how young people go on doing nothing. I\\'m just rolling up these rugs and blankets. I\\'m going to send them away.\"',\n",
       " '\"Now don\\'t tell me that!\" Uncle Henry yelled. \"Ain\\'t we got trouble enough here without him comin\\' back?\" He could have stood any calamity, it seemed, but the return to life of this wretched Morgan Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Now we shall visit,\" the bandit said, and put his arm through Gilbert\\'s. \"Ah! it ees so good to see you, my frand!\"',\n",
       " '\"Now you know me!\" Pancho went on. \"Ah! my frand! \\'Ow glad I am for to see you some more! Pedro! Venustiano! Ees my friend! Sabbe! Orders like my own! Serve \\'im as you would me!\" He went to Gilbert and frankly embraced him in the Latin fashion. \"Eet\\'s \\'ell of a good thing I reckernize you!\" he laughed, hugging his old friend close. He could never forget his kindness that night so many years ago; and to think he had run across his deliverer now!',\n",
       " '\"Now you know me?\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, Angela!\" said \"Red,\" his face the color of his flaming hair.',\n",
       " '\"Now, Angela--\" he said, and tried to grasp her arm. \"Remember, I\\'m here!\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, I\\'ve got you just where I want you!\" he snarled.',\n",
       " '\"Now, daddy--\" Angela began again.',\n",
       " '\"Now, father!\" she pleaded. She hated this business.',\n",
       " '\"Now, my frand \\'ere, \\'e wish to marry wiz you. Why, I do not know.\" Lopez grinned broadly. He knew this would be the last stroke. He was right.',\n",
       " '\"Now, wait a minute!\" Hardy begged. He could scarcely have this insult added to the host of others. \"I do love my country. I\\'m a good American.\"',\n",
       " '\"Now, zen, you all right some more, eh?\" he asked.',\n",
       " '\"Nozzing to get excite about!\" mimicked Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Of course I do.\" He got up, and walked over to the window. \"Your uncle don\\'t like jokin\\' much, does he? I asked him the other day why he didn\\'t get a chauffeur. Gosh! he got mad!\" \"Red\" laughed at the recollection.',\n",
       " '\"Of course I would!\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course it\\'s business,\" he replied. \"Precious little else I get.\" They were dining alone, at home, and he motioned the butler to refill his glass with champagne.',\n",
       " '\"Of course not. What are you talking about, you old fool?\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course, if you\\'re going to be nasty about it--\" Then, sweetly, to Gilbert she continued: \"Please don\\'t think too badly of us, Mr. Jones. Father doesn\\'t really mean any harm.\"',\n",
       " '\"Of course. What do you mean?\" She was at his side now.',\n",
       " '\"Of course. What of it?\" Gilbert was mystified.',\n",
       " '\"Oh! Oh!\" Sobs now came from her.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" Angela burst out, all confusion.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" The very thought made Angela ill.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" again came from the distracted Angela.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried Angela, when a full realization of what Uncle Henry meant came over her.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried Angela, who thought she had done so well.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried she. \"How can you speak of such things--now?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" cried the frightened girl now.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" gasped Angela.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" poor \"Red\" gasped, and leaped to his feet. \"Would you, Angela?\" He looked at her, drank her beauty in, as though she were the only creature on this earth.',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" the anguished \"Red\" managed to get out. \"Is there, Angy?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh!\" was all poor Angela could get out.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Gil--\" began Angela in tears.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" Gilbert said in desperation. What was the use in arguing with this barbarian? Yes, he was a barbarian--nothing else. They were miles apart. Centuries of belief and training separated them.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I see,\" cried Pell, wildly, and doing his best to keep his legs from giving way, \"you would kill me so that my wife can marry this Gilbert Jones?\" A sickly smile curled around his mouth.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'ll be through, all right--at eight o\\'clock to-night!\" Jasper Hardy announced, and drew several silver dollars out of his trousers pocket and rattled them about in his hand, significantly.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'ll get a job somewhere. Punch cows--or maybe join the rangers. There\\'s always something a fellow can do.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, I\\'m sorry! I ...\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Mr. Bandit!\" Angela put in once more.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, Mr. Robber!\" Angela cried.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, before the war we agreed to try our fortune together down here,\" \"Red\" told her; and the little machine went whirring along. \"That\\'s the Hardy ranch,\" he said, pointing to the left. \"Nice folks.\" His eyes seemed to cling to the low house, and Lucia did not realize it at the time, but he slowed up the car. Presently a young girl came out on the stone terrace and waved to him. She was like a prairie flower. \"Red\" Giddings became another man in the twinkling of an eye. A flush mounted to his cheeks, and a smile as broad as a fat man\\'s belt all but encircled his countenance. He took one hand from the wheel and waved until they were out of sight down a curve in the road.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, but that isn\\'t so!\" Angela broke in, fearful that the mere mention of killing would bring about a murder then and there. \"I\\'m sure it isn\\'t!\" Nothing must be said to raise the thought in Pancho\\'s mind.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, cut that out, Uncle,\" Gilbert implored; but there was a little note of irritation in his voice. \"That\\'s no way to talk of a guest under our roof.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, do let me help you,\" she said. \"I\\'d like to.\" And she leaned down, knelt beside him, and held her white forefinger on the cord.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, do let me pour some more coffee for you!\" Angela begged.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, don\\'t joke, Gil! You need a woman--a wife--someone to mother you.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, forget it! You don\\'t owe me nothin\\'!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, have you?\" Gilbert smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, ho! Leetle spitfire still!\" Pancho laughed. He chucked her under her pretty chin. \"So you marry ze man I pick for you, eh? Good! An\\' zis\"--pointing to the baby--\"zis ees better yet!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, how sweet you are, Pancho!\" she was saying. \"I don\\'t know what I ever did without you!\" And she kissed the baby\\'s cheek, which instantly took on a rosy hue.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, is that so?\" said Pell, beginning to see daylight. To young Jones he said: \"How far is it to town?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, it might have hit you!\" Angela cried and embraced him.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, it\\'s safe enough, I assure you. Would you like to try some of it?\" Gilbert suggested.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no! That would only make an issue of nothing. He doesn\\'t know anything? You\\'re sure? Oh, Lucia!\" He seemed suddenly overcome at their amazing meeting.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no!\" \"Red\" was quick to deny. \"I stand all right with him. He\\'s knowed me a long time. It\\'s her.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no,\" Jones said. \"We wanted a little Mexican touch in our households. And we\\'ve never forgotten you, old friend. Tell me, where have you been all these months? We hoped to hear from you. But never a word or a sign from you. Aren\\'t you just a little ashamed of yourself now, when you see how much we have been thinking of you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, nothing,\" Lucia Pell answered. \"You know how old people babble on sometimes about nothing.\" She turned and looked at him. Still the same handsome Gilbert! \"What are you doing?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, nothing--nothing at all.\" There was a nasal tone in his voice always--a twang that grated on sensitive ears. He turned on Gilbert. \"How about dinner?\" he asked, almost as though the young fellow were a hotel clerk.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so that\\'s it, is it? What\\'s the matter? Does her father object?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so that\\'s why you waved!\" disappointment in his tone.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so there ye be, me boy!\" was her motherly greeting. \"Come in, an\\' maybe--who knows?--I\\'ll find a cup o\\' coffee fer ye, though I\\'m not thinkin\\' ye deserve it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, so there you are, my dear!\" was his cynical greeting.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, somethin\\'. It\\'s a secret.\" He turned and addressed Lucia Pell. \"Don\\'t forget,\" he admonished, and swiftly wheeled himself out into the yard again.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, sort of like gasoline with bichloride of mercury in it,\" Jones answered his eager questioner.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, thank you!\" Angela was all smiles. She was making headway with this evil man. \"Thank you so much,\" she followed up, and, standing sweetly at his left, she poured the brown stuff into his cup. \"Lovely weather, isn\\'t it?\" she remarked. The cook took the pot from her, and went back to the kitchen with it.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, these New York fellers!\" Hardy deprecated. \"You never can tell!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, two hundred dollars,\" Jasper Hardy grandly said.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, very well!\" Uncle Henry replied. He pushed his chair toward the door, murmuring as he went, \"Thank God I ain\\'t his wife! That\\'s all I got to say!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, will you, daddy--for my sake?\" Angela pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, you would--\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, you wouldn\\'t do that!\" said the kindly, honest \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, ze wolf in ze sheep\\'s overcoat!\" the bandit smirked.',\n",
       " '\"Oil not interests me,\" the bandit explained.',\n",
       " '\"Oil!\" he said. \"Then this ranch, instead of being worth nothing, would be worth hundreds of thousand of dollars--maybe millions!\" He had taken the bag from Pell\\'s extended hand, and now turned in dismay and confusion to the window, and put the bag on a chair. What a world it was, and how terrible that every other man seemed to be a predatory animal, ready to spring upon his neighbor and wrest anything he had away from him. What a world, indeed! No wonder young men lost their faith and courage!',\n",
       " '\"Oil?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"On the level?\" said Pell, eagerly.',\n",
       " '\"One promises to love, honor, and obey, in sickness and in health, till death shall part.\"',\n",
       " '\"Only a mere trifle of six months\\' wages,\" Gilbert laughed.',\n",
       " '\"Only a minute ago I heard you call him a gol darn fool!\" Hardy triumphantly reminded him.',\n",
       " '\"Only one guess!\" Lucia begged.',\n",
       " '\"Order a man around in his own house.\"',\n",
       " '\"Other plans!\" she cried.',\n",
       " '\"Out,\" was Pell\\'s curt reply; and he almost knocked Uncle Henry\\'s chair aside as he hurried into the yard.',\n",
       " '\"Packed up yet?\" he inquired, sarcastically, as though he meant to intimate that his coming journey would be a pleasant one.',\n",
       " '\"Pah! It\\'s too many damn rules in your army. For us who make revolution, no! We sleep so late we damn please. We fight some when we feel so. If we find ze hacienda, we take all what we choose. When we need money, we go to city and rob ze bank--we \\'elp for ourselves food from ze store, shoes, clothes, candy, ze cigarette, agauriante--\" he made as if to drink from an imaginary glass--\"booze! An\\' if anybody \\'ide anysing we cut \\'is fingers off so\\'s \\'e tell us. She is one fine life! You like for try? I make you general! Come!\"',\n",
       " '\"Pancho Lopez?\" Pell repeated, frightened almost to the breaking point.',\n",
       " '\"Pay me off?\" That would have been heaven! He could have taken Angela to the movies at Bisbee.',\n",
       " '\"Pedro,\" said Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Pells?\"',\n",
       " '\"Persuade him to what?\"',\n",
       " '\"Please don\\'t take me with you!\" Lucia appealed. Why had Morgan Pell ever brought her to this border line? She might have known better than to come. It was no place for a young and attractive woman.',\n",
       " '\"Please!\" Lucia pleaded.',\n",
       " '\"Pleased to meet you,\" answered Hardy, and turned away, \"Red\" and Angela, interested spectators of this foolish proceeding, sat together on the little settee by the window near the door, and smiled at the shillyshallying of two grown men who should have known better. Civilization! A mockery, surely, when two men couldn\\'t be amenable in the presence of others--two men who apparently had no reason for treating each other this way.',\n",
       " '\"Pleased to meet you,\" he said, and put out a white hand. \"How long you goin\\' to stay?\"',\n",
       " '\"Poco tiempo!\" the bandit said.',\n",
       " '\"Pronto,\" Lopez said. Then, to Lucia, \"Ze bread.\" She leaned over to get a piece for him. He watched her carefully. \"Your hand is shake. For why? You \\'fraid from me, perhaps?\"',\n",
       " '\"Pronto,\" ordered Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Proof?\" cried Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"Protect her!\" Gilbert said, drawing Lucia closer to his heart.',\n",
       " '\"Protect yourself!\" repeated Gilbert, cynicism in his tone. He turned his back on them all and moved to the window. His very shoulders revealed the mental struggle he was going through.',\n",
       " '\"Put that down,\" said Hardy contemptuously. \"You might hurt somebody,\" he added, smiling.',\n",
       " '\"Put what over?\" Gilbert asked.',\n",
       " '\"Quite,\" answered Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Quite.\" And young Jones handed him the option on the property.',\n",
       " '\"Ransom!\" the former cried.',\n",
       " '\"Really? It doesn\\'t seem possible!\"',\n",
       " '\"Really?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" could stand this now: he had his Angela. And tucked in his big arm, he took her outdoors.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" did not understand. \"Gol darn what?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had been listening attentively. He came close to Gilbert now, and said, \"He wants the place. Didn\\'t he just say so?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had gone out of the room; but he came back now. \"Better get inside,\" he warned them all, definite fear in his voice. \"We\\'re in range. It\\'s pretty dangerous. As I said, accidents don\\'t happen down in this country.\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had gone over and looked out of the window. Twilight had definitely come, and the sky was a great sheet of flame. Orange, pink, purple, and red, the clouds shifted over the face of the dying sun. A king going down to his death could not have passed in greater glory. While men and women fought their little battles, waged their puny quarrels, this stately miracle occurred once more. Unmindful of the grief of mortals, the day was about to pass into the arms of the waiting night.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had not been able to dodge a shot. \"Right through the hat!\" he cried, and waved his Stetson. Sure enough, a bullet had gone clean through his headgear. Had he lifted his face a few inches higher, he would have been shot himself.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" had put his head in one hand, and leaned back on the case, at peace with the world. His left foot beat a little tattoo on the side of the box. Now he sat up straight and looked sharply at Jones.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" intervened. \"Listen, Angela--\" he began.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" jumped at the question. \"What\\'s the matter?\" His nerves were on edge.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" loved the odors from this fragrant kitchen. The stove always gleamed, and when Mrs. Quinn was in good humor she was like a great light moving here and there, dispensing warmth also. She was a monstrous woman; but like many large people, she got about easily and swiftly. Her capable hands were forever fluttering in the flour-barrel or over the dough-board, and her ruddy cheeks and honest gray eyes spoke of health and good nature. She adored Angela; and she really liked \"Red\" tremendously, and hoped in the end he would win the difficult and fickle girl. But, like Angela, she had moment when she could have shaken him. For \"Red\" didn\\'t fight hard enough for what he wanted. He was naïve to the point of stupidity at times; and women like aggressive men--even men who are capable of flogging them into submission, deny it as they will. \"Red\" was gentle and mild, though thoroughly manly. Both Angela and Mrs. Quinn would have liked to see him live up to his fiery hair.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" nodded.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" rose slowly. His voice was almost a whisper. \"He\\'s alive!\" he breathed.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" sprang up. \"Rangers!\" he cried. \"They\\'re shooting!\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" stepped forward. \"Back, everybody!\" he ordered. He pushed everyone farther back into the room, until they were all crowded in one corner. Uncle Henry was trembling like a leaf. How he wished he had never been brought to this strange country! Oh, for the peace of Bangor, Maine! There was a place for you! Down here it was all shooting, killing, and desperate trouble. Having escaped one crisis, was it possible the fates were to be so unkind as to put him in the way of another, from which there might be no extrication? Curse the luck, anyhow. Gol darn it!',\n",
       " '\"Red\" turned and looked at his employer. He didn\\'t know whether he should ask the next question or not; but he took his courage in his hands.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" turned. \"Accidents don\\'t happen in Arizona--leastwise not with guns.\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\" was certain they could not. \"There ain\\'t a chance, at that range,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\" was suspicious still. He looked at Gilbert. \"You don\\'t think he\\'ll try any funny business, do you? You\\'re sure you won\\'t need me around?\"',\n",
       " '\"Red\\'s trying to sober him up,\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"Red\\'s\" face gleamed as if a lantern had been lighted behind it. He turned eagerly to Angela. \"Will I!\" he cried.',\n",
       " '\"Remember,\" his master commanded. \"Shoot ze first one which interrup\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"Right,\" Pell replied.',\n",
       " '\"Rob \\'im? Rob my frand?\" Lopez repeated.',\n",
       " '\"Robbed the bank?\" Gilbert was wide-eyed now.',\n",
       " '\"Santa Maria del Rio de Guadaloupe!\" he cried. \"\\'Ow many time I got for to kill you to-day, any\\'ow? Now, damn to \\'ell, mebbe you stay dead a while, eh?\" He looked down at the shriveled form. And as of old he called to his henchman, \"Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"Santa Maria--You come here.\"',\n",
       " '\"Say you will!\" \"Red\" pleaded, almost distracted.',\n",
       " '\"Say, I\\'m goin\\' to poke that bird in the beak some day!\" \"Red\" declared.',\n",
       " '\"Say, ain\\'t you got no heart at all?\" Uncle Henry wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Say, boy, you better use your head. You\\'re going to marry my darter, ain\\'t you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, five hundred dollars,\" the loan shark generously offered.',\n",
       " '\"Say, how about dinner?\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, where are you goin\\'?\" Hardy cried.',\n",
       " '\"Say, who the \\'ell is that?\" said Lopez, addressing himself to Gilbert.',\n",
       " '\"Say, you don\\'t think you love him again, do you?\" Hardy wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Say,\" Angela said, watching him, \"you seem to like that coffee a lot more than you like me! That brunette in the cup is my rival!\"',\n",
       " '\"Say,\" he wanted to know, \"who\\'s this woman, and what\\'s she busting into this for? We\\'ve had enough of petticoats around here for one day, it seems to me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Senile yourself!\" cried Uncle Henry, mad through and through, feeling he was immune from any attack. \"Gol darn you!\"',\n",
       " '\"Señor Wall Street,\" the bandit now addressed Pell, \"you \\'ave ten sousand dollar. I want it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Señors, señoras!\" he announced, in fascinating broken English, \"you are all my preesoner!\"',\n",
       " '\"Shall I bandage your wound for you?\" his dutiful wife asked.',\n",
       " '\"Shall he come wiz me to Mexico,\" the bandit piled it on, \"I will give \\'im planty wives, young, beautiful....\"',\n",
       " '\"She ain\\'t got no money,\" Uncle Henry informed the room.',\n",
       " '\"She gets it all--the wife,\" Hardy told Lopez. \"That is, if the husband hasn\\'t made a will.\"',\n",
       " '\"She told me she would.\" He got it out bravely.',\n",
       " '\"Shet your head!\" Uncle Henry cried; but not angrily--not now. He laughed when he said it, and was secretly flattered that anyone thought he had such pep at his age and in his condition of semi-invalidism (for that is all it could be called now).',\n",
       " '\"Shot through the shoulder,\" Gilbert answered promptly.',\n",
       " '\"Should I waste my time listening to sings which are not true?\"',\n",
       " '\"Should have been ready two hours ago. What\\'s the matter? Wish we had Mrs. Quinn over here.\"',\n",
       " '\"Shouldn\\'t you have asked that first--as a good business man?\"',\n",
       " '\"Show us where she is?\" Hardy asked, breathless.',\n",
       " '\"Shut up! How many times must I tell you to--\"',\n",
       " '\"Shut up!\" Lopez was genuinely infuriated now. \"Ees no use for talk wiz such fools. You make me seek! Such ideas! Not fit for ze child to \\'ave! No blood, no courage! Only ze liver what are white and ze soul what are yellow.\" Gilbert winced at the word. \"Americans! Bah! Fishes! Zat is all! Fishes what ees poor! Bah! For you I am finish!\" And he snapped his fingers again. His face was purple with rage.',\n",
       " '\"Si!\" laughed Lopez.',\n",
       " '\"Si, Madre di Dios!\" cried the cook; and fled to his kitchen, tumbling over himself in his eagerness to get a meal for the bandit.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez answered.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez said. \"Sit down. Sit down.\" Angela thought of course he was speaking to her, and being kind to her because of her girlish attentions. So she promptly seated herself. \"No, not you!\" Pancho said roughly, putting six spoons of sugar in this second cup. \"You, I mean,\" indicating Lucia once more. Angela pouted, and turned her back on this bad, bad man. Pancho never even noticed her. The more opulent beauty of Lucia appealed to the sensuous in him. \"You,\" he repeated. \"Tell me, señora, \\'ave you never been to a free country?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" Lopez smiled. And Pedro got the invalid and the lanky Hardy through the door, as a woman might have swept two geese from her path.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered Alvarada; and after he had made certain that Pedro and Venustiano could handle the three men, one of whom, after all, was but an invalid in a wheel chair, he made his way to the kitchen. He knew there were two other companions who would help in any emergency. They slunk in the background, cigarettes between their lips, guns always ready for action. The house was completely surrounded.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered Lopez, calmly.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" answered the faithful minion of the bandit, stepping forward.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" remarked Lopez, evidently pleased at the sight. \"An\\' now, \\'ow much weigh?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" said Pedro again, and grinned broadly and pleasantly. If there was one thing he liked, it was the possibility of trouble with prisoners. He knew how to bring them to terms. He had been doing it for years.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" the faithful one answered, and came to his master.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" the latter said, meekly.',\n",
       " '\"Si,\" was the quick answer.',\n",
       " '\"Si. Ah, my frand, I \\'ave make ze man from you at last! Fine man what would kill for \\'is woman!\" He patted him on the shoulder.',\n",
       " '\"Si. Is it so agree?\"',\n",
       " '\"Si. My frand\"--his hand went to Gilbert\\'s shoulder--\"ees great opportunity, ees revolution, for make speed. When I got well, I find I do not enjoy my work, which are \\'ard. Business? Business, she make me sick! I say for myself, \\'What to do?\\' Zen, suddenly I sink, \\'I shall be soldado!\\' Soldier which shall be giv ze \\'orse, ze gun, ze woman, and nozzing to do but shoot a little sometimes! Ees a wonderful life, my frand!\" The smoke of his cigarette curled to the ceiling.',\n",
       " '\"Si.\" He was unmoved by her apprehension. He walked to the very center of the room, and looked about him, studying all their faces.',\n",
       " '\"Si.\" Lopez had never used a politer tone.',\n",
       " '\"Simply that he\\'s been imbibing again. That\\'s why dinner is so late. But we\\'re getting used to it. There is nothing to do but stand it.\"',\n",
       " '\"So if we don\\'t get ten thousand dollars there by eight o\\'clock to-night, we\\'re set out on the bricks without no more home than a prairie dog--not as much!\" almost screamed Uncle Henry. \"An\\' yet you say why talk about it?\"',\n",
       " '\"So it seems!\" Morgan Pell answered, his lip curling. \"My dear, I regret to disappoint you. But aside from a slight pain in my head, I was never better in my whole life!\" He wanted to see the effect of his words.',\n",
       " '\"So there you are!\" he half sneered. \"Been riding?\"',\n",
       " '\"So you take ze rancho from my friend, Señor Jones. A nice sort of neighbor you are, you beeg fish!\"',\n",
       " '\"So zat, after \\'aving promise to love, honor, and hobey,\" he tapped off one finger at a time, and looked as if he wanted to get this mysterious matter straight in his mind, \"until death, you \\'ave ze right to break your word because ze judge say you can? Is zat it?\"',\n",
       " '\"So! You do love \\'im, after all!\" the bandit said to Angela.',\n",
       " '\"So!\" Lopez was interested, \"\\'Er \\'usband? \\'E \\'as money?\"',\n",
       " '\"So!\" her husband cried, significantly. Now she realized, in a blinding flash, the cruel subtlety behind his test of her. Her head went back; she closed her eyes. And then--how she did it she never knew--she raised her mouth.',\n",
       " '\"So!\" was all Lopez said, turning on Pell, and nodding his head. \"Ees nice wife--I like her. You do not mind, do you?\" His hand touched Lucia\\'s arm. \"Ees all right. I shall ask no question. You shall answer what I ask. And as is my custom, anybody what does not tell ze truth shall be quite suddenly--\" he paused just the portion of a second--\"shot.\"',\n",
       " '\"So, if you do not marry soon, it will be too late.\"',\n",
       " '\"So,\" she said. \"We\\'re back just where we started from!\" The grim humor of it came over her. Ten minutes ago she had thought her husband dead--done for, out of the way. Now he stood before her in all his virility, in all his cruelty; and behind him was the one man in the world that she loved.',\n",
       " '\"Sold ten head of cattle this morning, and Montrose says he\\'ll take as many more when I\\'m ready for him. Great, isn\\'t it? \\'Red\\' been over to-day?\"',\n",
       " '\"Some what? And who?\"',\n",
       " '\"Some women could have done it,\" he told her, sternly. \"But not you, my dear....\" Fury and sarcasm were in his tone. \"So! That\\'s it, is it? And I stand blindly by while you and he ...\"',\n",
       " '\"Sorry for you, lady,\" said Bradley, perfunctorily, as he might have said \"Good-morning.\" He turned now to go. \"Don\\'t touch him till the coroner comes,\" he commanded. \"Mind what I say.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sorry! Ees all you can say--sorry! Ze coward! Ze fool! Ze fish what are poor! Ze damn doormat for everybody to walk from!\" His arms were flying in the air. \"All day I \\'ave try to make ze man from you! It are no use. Ees no man in you. Only ze damn fool what are sorry! Bah! All right. You will not let me make you \\'appy? Bueno! Zen I shall go back and make you on\\'appy and serve you damn good right!\" He pointed to Lucia. \"You will not take \\'er?\"',\n",
       " '\"Splendidly!\" the young wife replied, glad that the atmosphere was cleared once more. \"Oh, Gil, it\\'s wonderful here--nothing but sky and the golden desert! What a miracle place!\"',\n",
       " '\"Sturgis telegraphed me that there was a big possibility of a new vein of oil down on the border,\" Pell was telling her. \"Some important men want to talk things over with me at Bisbee. I want to get started in a day or two. Don\\'t take your maid. It\\'s a rough country, but you\\'ll be all right. Just old clothes. You can ride a lot, so bring your habit. I\\'ll be busy most of the time; but I think you\\'ll like the trip. Never been down that way, have you?\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure I would!\" came from the wheel chair.',\n",
       " '\"Sure! All day I \\'ave want \\'er. Ees ze first time in my life when I want woman all day and not--as favor I give \\'er to you. Now, since you too big damn fool not to take \\'er yourself, I take \\'er myself. And what you know about \\'im?\" He paused, and called out, \"Pedro!\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure! Ees what I go to town for.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sure! In one half hour,\" the bandit was convinced.',\n",
       " '\"Sure!\" laughed Pancho.',\n",
       " '\"Sure, an\\' you\\'re welcome, me boy.\" Angela had gone out on the step. The old Irishwoman saw her chance. \"For the love o\\' Mike, \\'Red,\\' woo her, an\\' woo her hard! There is a feller in Bisbee. She\\'s after lovin\\' ye, but you\\'re too slow--slower\\'n the molasses I just poured on yer griddle-cakes fer ye!\"',\n",
       " '\"Surely we can play a part. It isn\\'t as if we were children,\" she said, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"Take what to the courts?\" Pell wanted to know.',\n",
       " '\"Ten thousand dollars,\" came the quick response.',\n",
       " '\"Tequila? What\\'s that, Jones?\"',\n",
       " '\"Texas rangers after you?\" asked \"Red,\" startled.',\n",
       " '\"Texas?\" from Pell.',\n",
       " '\"Thank Gawd, I ain\\'t got nothin\\' to lie about!\" was Uncle Henry\\'s relieved thought, expressed aloud.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" Pell said; and he threw wide the door leading from the alcove so that his host might pass through. He waited for him to do so. Gilbert hesitated for the fraction of a second. He looked at Pell, and then at Lucia, still lovely for all her suffering. There was nothing to say--nothing he could say. He disappeared into the other room, and shut the door behind him. Pell immediately turned to the others. \"Well?\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" said Gilbert. \"Do you mind putting your finger--there? Never mind. I think I can do it, after all.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thank you,\" said Pell to Gilbert. Then, to his wife he said: \"And now that this is settled, we shall proceed to other business of even more importance. This gentle soul,\" looking at Uncle Henry, \"has said that our friend loves you and that you love him. Is it true?\" He was perfectly calm.',\n",
       " '\"Thanks,\" the ranger said. He went back to the door, and pushed the jug to the lips of his prisoner. \"Take a swig o\\' that.\" Lopez did so. His humiliation was evident even in his back. And only a little while ago he had been the monarch of all he surveyed! Now he was the slave of Bradley, and must ride, hand-cuffed, to the jail a few miles away.',\n",
       " '\"Thanks; much obliged,\" \"Red\" said, filling his pipe. \"But darn that cook, anyhow! If he wasn\\'t leavin\\', I\\'d fire him! As if you didn\\'t have enough troubles, without havin\\' to bother about late meals--an\\' guests in the house.\"',\n",
       " '\"That don\\'t prove nothin\\'. Mebbe he hasn\\'t found the oil yet. But it\\'s here! If it ain\\'t, why should you be fightin\\' so hard to get this rotten place? Tell me that, will you? Nobody else ever wanted it--except this kindly neighbor of ours!\" He glared at Hardy triumphantly.',\n",
       " '\"That is, if it ain\\'t too much,\" Hardy craftily added.',\n",
       " '\"That makes it all the better,\" Pell was shrewd enough to say. \"Then he\\'d lose his money quick, and be satisfied.\" And he laughed at what he thought a witticism.',\n",
       " '\"That was different. You\\'re married now. Oh, there is a vast change since then. I could not--Forgive me, my dear.\" He turned away his face. He did not want her to read what was in his eyes. \"Shall I send them, or would you rather take them with you?\" he asked, hiding behind that commonplace question the emotion he felt. His voice held a note of pain.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s all right. Keep it; you may need it later on,\" said Pell, as though the jug were his to give away.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s exactly what I do mean,\" Morgan Pell stated, firmly. \"And the sooner the better.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s one of my main reasons,\" Hardy cruelly announced; and the only come-back poor Uncle Henry had was an exasperated, \"Oh, is that so!\" drawled out peevishly, weakly.',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s what I say,\" Uncle Henry declared. He could hardly wait to get to the cake, for he knew what toothsome dainties the Irishwoman could cause to emerge from her oven; and often she sent him this or that sweet, \"just to let \\'im know she was livin\\' an\\' breathin\\'.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s what I was hoping. So you\\'d like to go--really?\"',\n",
       " '\"The Bangor Daily Commercial, printed at Bangor, Maine. An\\' that\\'s the only decent town in the whole gol darn world. Wisht I was there now!\" He glanced at the alcove that led to another room, as if conscious that Morgan Pell might have heard him. He wanted to say something more to Gilbert, but something told him he had better keep silent. Instead, he read an item from the paper aloud to him. \"Listen to this, Gilbert,\" he said: \"\\'The Elite Fish Market has just received five barrels of soft clams from Eastport. Get there early, feller citizens! They won\\'t last long.\\' Think o\\' that, Gilbert? Clams!\" He smacked his lips, and even forgot how warm it was. \"Clams! An\\' I ain\\'t even seen one in five long years! Not even a clam!\" He turned his chair suddenly, and looked out of the open door, where the country meandered away. \"This is a hell of a hole! Why did we ever come down here?\" he whined. He swung about again, and faced his nephew. \"Say, Gil, do they have clams in France?\"',\n",
       " '\"The Mexicans like their liquor strong,\" young Jones explained. \"That\\'s what\\'s the matter with the cook.\"',\n",
       " '\"The bandit,\" Uncle Henry answered.',\n",
       " '\"The cook\\'s getting dinner now. Have a good canter, you say?\" young Jones inquired.',\n",
       " '\"The cook,\" he laughed. \"He is dronk!\" He now addressed him directly: \"You are dronk,\" he affirmed, and stamped his foot.',\n",
       " '\"The desert,\" Lucia answered.',\n",
       " '\"The finest in the world!\" Uncle Henry affirmed. \"Now, looky here, Mis\\' Pell: He won\\'t listen to me--funny the way folks are about their relatives. But I was thinkin\\' that mebbe if you was to ask him--\"',\n",
       " '\"The first million we make out of the oil that\\'s here!\" \"Uncle Henry proposed. And, serious as things were getting to be, a smile went around the group.',\n",
       " '\"The line forms on the left,\" the imperturbable Hardy said. \"You\\'re the fifth that\\'s had that hope this year. I don\\'t care a rap what you think, old feller! Remember that!\"',\n",
       " '\"The place?\" Gilbert repeated. \"What the devil does he want the place for?\"',\n",
       " '\"The poor stiffs!\" said Uncle Henry.',\n",
       " '\"The rangers came,\" Hardy explained.',\n",
       " '\"The rugs I\\'m presenting to a friend of mine. The crockery goes to the cook. He has a family, you know.\" His irony was lost on the imperturbable Hardy, who merely asked:',\n",
       " '\"The sky, then!\" Lucia affirmed.',\n",
       " '\"The time\\'s up at eight o\\'clock,\" was all he said, and looked sternly at Gilbert, much as a judge who is pronouncing sentence looks at the prisoner at the bar.',\n",
       " '\"Them crockery, and the rugs?\" pointing to the articles significantly.',\n",
       " '\"Then I reckon I\\'ll have to foreclose,\" he went on relentlessly. \"There\\'s nothing else to do.\" His hands closed tightly, and his hard eyes looked even harder.',\n",
       " '\"Then I\\'d advise him not to buy here,\" said Gilbert, much to Pell\\'s amazement.',\n",
       " '\"Then I\\'ll make it a hundred and eighty!\" his antagonist stated.',\n",
       " '\"Then it wasn\\'t you they captured?\" Gilbert said.',\n",
       " '\"Then sit right down,\" Lucia said, \"There\\'s plenty--far more than the last time you were here!\" And they all laughed.',\n",
       " '\"Then that\\'s settled,\" Pell announced.',\n",
       " '\"Then we won\\'t see each other again?\"',\n",
       " '\"Then what\\'s the idea of this auction in the first place?\" Pell asked, mad through and through that they had been tricked by this Mexican fool.',\n",
       " '\"Then why are you giving it up?\" was the natural question.',\n",
       " '\"Then why don\\'t you, Gil? She\\'d make you very happy--a woman like that. I want you to understand.\"',\n",
       " '\"There could be only one name in all the world for that youngster,\" Gilbert said, and put his hand affectionately on his old friend\\'s shoulder. \"You ought to know it as well as I. Of course his name is--Pancho!\"',\n",
       " '\"There is oil here?\" Pell asked excitedly.',\n",
       " '\"There you are,\" said Gilbert, addressing his uncle. \"That\\'s what you get--\"',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s more,\" Gilbert cried. \"I\\'ll get it.\" He went hurriedly to the kitchen.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s no use your trying to tell me. Is that what you were going to say?\" His face showed his rage.',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s nothing good in the place. But I think the cook has some tequila.\"',\n",
       " '\"There\\'s some down in the hay barn. Want me to get it for you?\" \"Red\" offered.',\n",
       " '\"They are ze best because each man makes them for \\'imself. Not like New York, where everybody tell you what you cannot do until zere is nozzing left what you want to do.\"',\n",
       " '\"They see him!\" cried \"Red.\"',\n",
       " '\"They should of shot \\'im in the stomach!\" Uncle Henry stated. What a mess! What rotten luck, ran through his weary brain.',\n",
       " '\"They tell me it\\'s God\\'s country, with big chances for everyone. I want to add to our little pile, Lucia,\" Pell went on. He hoped she would get the significance of the \"our.\"',\n",
       " '\"They\\'ll hang you!\" Gilbert warned.',\n",
       " '\"They\\'re not both fellers!\" Angela made bold to say. \"One\\'s a girl--that one! She\\'s mine!\"',\n",
       " '\"This court does. Somebody told the judge where he could get a bottle of liquor for eighteen dollars,\" Gilbert added, and smiled.',\n",
       " '\"This is Pancho Lopez!\" \"Red\" Giddings said. Everyone\\'s hands were lifted, and pistols were held by the Mexicans, ready to go off at the slightest sign of rebellion.',\n",
       " '\"This ranch belongs to you, doesn\\'t it?\" he put the question direct to Jones.',\n",
       " '\"To Mexico!\" Uncle Henry said. \"This country\\'s gettin\\' so it ain\\'t fit to live in!\" And he whirled out of the room.',\n",
       " '\"To fight you?\" Pell looked him squarely in the eye. \"I do not. I\\'ve had all the fighting I want for one day. Now, my own course is simple. I have merely to go back to New York and forget that either of you ever existed. But your problem is more difficult. It\\'s after eight. You\\'ve lost the ranch. And you have no money.\"',\n",
       " '\"To marry her,\" Smith brazenly said.',\n",
       " '\"To marry you, of course!\"',\n",
       " '\"To zat, I \\'ave come at last,\" the bandit replied with an emphasis that could not be mistaken.',\n",
       " '\"Told you we\\'d better keep inside!\" \"Red\" said.',\n",
       " '\"Too much!\" Lopez explained.',\n",
       " '\"Trick for what?\" the bandit wanted to know. He nodded to Pedro. \"Get ze men. \\'E will not shoot!\"',\n",
       " '\"Trouble?\" Lopez let out the word in wrath. \"You are no trouble. You only sink you are.\"',\n",

       "'“After all, I have never blamed my mother; she knew little of me. Mothers who lead a life like that of the Duchesse d’Uxelles keep their children at a distance. I saw and knew nothing of the world until my marriage. You can judge of my innocence! I knew nothing; I was incapable of understanding the causes of my marriage. I had a fine fortune; sixty thousand francs a year in forests, which the Revolution overlooked (or had not been able to sell) in the Nivernais, with the noble chateau of d’Anzy. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was steeped in debt. Later I learned what it was to have debts, but then I was too utterly ignorant of life to suspect my position; the money saved out of my fortune went to pacify my husband’s creditors. Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was forty-eight years of age when I married him; but those years were like military campaigns, they ought to count for twice what they were. Ah! what a life I led for ten years! If any one had known the suffering of this poor, calumniated little woman! To be watched by a mother jealous of her daughter! Heavens! You who make dramas, you will never invent anything as direful as that. Ordinarily, according to the little that I know of literature, a drama is a suite of actions, speeches, movements which hurry to a catastrophe; but what I speak of was a catastrophe in action. It was an avalanche fallen in the morning and falling again at night only to fall again the next day. I am cold now as I speak to you of that cavern without an opening, cold, sombre, in which I lived. I, poor little thing that I was! brought up in a convent like a mystic rose, knowing nothing of marriage, developing late, I was happy at first; I enjoyed the goodwill and harmony of our family. The birth of my poor boy, who is all me--you must have been struck by the likeness? my hair, my eyes, the shape of my face, my mouth, my smile, my teeth!--well, his birth was a relief to me; my thoughts were diverted by the first joys of maternity from my husband, who gave me no pleasure and did nothing for me that was kind or amiable; those joys were all the keener because I knew no others. It had been so often rung into my ears that a mother should respect herself. Besides, a young girl loves to play the mother. I was so proud of my flower--for Georges was beautiful, a miracle, I thought! I saw and thought of nothing but my son, I lived with my son. I never let his nurse dress or undress him. Such cares, so wearing to mothers who have a regiment of children, were all my pleasure. But after three or four years, as I was not an actual fool, light came to my eyes in spite of the pains taken to blindfold me. Can you see me at that final awakening, in 1819? The drama of ‘The Brothers at enmity’ is a rose-water tragedy beside that of a mother and daughter placed as we then were. But I braved them all, my mother, my husband, the world, by public coquetries which society talked of,--and heaven knows how it talked! You can see, my friend, how the men with whom I was accused of folly were to me the dagger with which to stab my enemies. Thinking only of my vengeance, I did not see or feel the wounds I was inflicting on myself. Innocent as a child, I was thought a wicked woman, the worst of women, and I knew nothing of it! The world is very foolish, very blind, very ignorant; it can penetrate no secrets but those which amuse it and serve its malice: noble things, great things, it puts its hand before its eyes to avoid seeing. But, as I look back, it seems to me that I had an attitude and aspect of indignant innocence, with movements of pride, which a great painter would have recognized. I must have enlivened many a ball with my tempests of anger and disdain. Lost poesy! such sublime poems are only made in the glowing indignation which seizes us at twenty. Later, we are wrathful no longer, we are too weary, vice no longer amazes us, we are cowards, we fear. But then--oh! I kept a great pace! For all that I played the silliest personage in the world; I was charged with crimes by which I never benefited. But I had such pleasure in compromising myself. That was my revenge! Ah! I have played many childish tricks! I went to Italy with a thoughtless youth, whom I crushed when he spoke to me of love, but later, when I herd that he was compromised on my account (he had committed a forgery to get money) I rushed to save him. My mother and husband kept me almost without means; but, this time, I went to the king. Louis XVIII., that man without a heart, was touched; he gave me a hundred thousand francs from his privy purse. The Marquis d’Esgrignon--you must have seen him in society for he ended by making a rich marriage--was saved from the abyss into which he had plunged for my sake. That adventure, caused by my own folly, led me to reflect. I saw that I myself was the first victim of my vengeance. My mother, who knew I was too proud, too d’Uxelles, to conduct myself really ill, began to see the harm that she had done me and was frightened by it. She was then fifty-two years of age; she left Paris and went to live at Uxelles. There she expiates her wrong-doing by a life of devotion and expresses the utmost affection for me. After her departure I was face to face, alone, with Monsieur de Maufrigneuse. Oh! my friend, you men can never know what an old man of gallantry can be. What a home is that of a man accustomed to the adulation of women of the world, when he finds neither incense nor censer in his own house! dead to all! and yet, perhaps for that very reason, jealous. I wished--when Monsieur de Maufrigneuse was wholly mine--I wished to be a good wife, but I found myself repulsed with the harshness of a soured spirit by a man who treated me like a child and took pleasure in humiliating my self-respect at every turn, in crushing me under the scorn of his experience, and in convicting me of total ignorance. He wounded me on all occasions. He did everything to make me detest him and to give me the right to betray him; but I was still the dupe of my own hope and of my desire to do right through several years. Shall I tell you the cruel saying that drove me to further follies? ‘The Duchesse de Maufrigneuse has gone back to her husband,’ said the world. ‘Bah! it is always a triumph to bring the dead to life; it is all she can now do,’ replied my best friend, a relation, she, at whose house I met you--”'"

       " ' I have called this Lecture \"Christian Platonism and Speculative Mysticism.\" Admirers of Plato are likely to protest that Plato himself can hardly be called a mystic, and that in any case there is very little resemblance between the philosophy of his dialogues and the semi-Oriental Mysticism of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. I do not dispute either of these statements; and yet I wish to keep the name of Plato in the title of this Lecture. The affinity between Christianity and Platonism was very strongly felt throughout the period which we are now to consider. Justin Martyr claims Plato (with Heraclitus[107] and Socrates) as a Christian before Christ; Athenagoras calls him the best of the forerunners of Christianity, and Clement regards the Gospel as perfected Platonism.[108] The Pagans repeated so persistently the charge that Christ borrowed from Plato what was true in His teaching, that Ambrose wrote a treatise to confute them. As a rule, the Christians did not deny the resemblance, but explained it by saying that Plato had plagiarised from Moses--a curious notion which we find first in Philo. In the Middle Ages the mystics almost canonised Plato: Eckhart speaks of him, quaintly enough, as \"the great priest\" (der grosse Pfaffe); and even in Spain, Louis of Granada calls him \"divine,\" and finds in him \"the most excellent parts of Christian wisdom.\" Lastly, in the seventeenth century the English Platonists avowed their intention of bringing back the Church to \"her old loving nurse the Platonic philosophy.\" These English Platonists knew what they were talking of; but for the mediæval mystics Platonism meant the philosophy of Plotinus adapted by Augustine, or that of Proclus adapted by Dionysius, or the curious blend of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Jewish philosophy which filtered through into the Church by means of the Arabs. Still, there was justice underlying this superficial ignorance. Plato is, after all, the father of European Mysticism.[109] Both the great types of mystics may appeal to him--those who try to rise through the visible to the invisible, through Nature to God, who find in earthly beauty the truest symbol of the heavenly, and in the imagination--the image-making faculty--a raft whereon we may navigate the shoreless ocean of the Infinite; and those who distrust all sensuous representations as tending \"to nourish appetites which we ought to starve,\" who look upon this earth as a place of banishment, upon material things as a veil which hides God\\'s face from us, and who bid us \"flee away from hence as quickly as may be,\" to seek \"yonder,\" in the realm of the ideas, the heart\\'s true home. Both may find in the real Plato much congenial teaching--that the highest good is the greatest likeness to God--that the greatest happiness is the vision of God--that we should seek holiness not for the sake of external reward, but because it is the health of the soul, while vice is its disease--that goodness is unity and harmony, while evil is discord and disintegration--that it is our duty and happiness to rise above the visible and transitory to the invisible and permanent. It may also be a pleasure to some to trace the fortunes of the positive and negative elements in Plato\\'s teaching--of the humanist and the ascetic who dwelt together in that large mind; to observe how the world-renouncing element had to grow at the expense of the other, until full justice had been done to its claims; and then how the brighter, more truly Hellenic side was able to assert itself under due safeguards, as a precious thing dearly purchased, a treasure reserved for the pure and humble, and still only to be tasted carefully, with reverence and godly fear. There is, of course, no necessity for connecting this development with the name of Plato. The way towards a reconciliation of this and other differences is more clearly indicated in the New Testament; indeed, nothing can strengthen our belief in inspiration so much as to observe how the whole history of thought only helps us to understand St. Paul and St. John better, never to pass beyond their teaching. Still, the traditional connexion between Plato and Mysticism is so close that we may, I think, be pardoned for keeping, like Ficinus, a lamp burning in his honour throughout our present task.',\n",
       " ' In my last Lecture I showed how the later Mysticism emancipated itself from the mischievous doctrine that the spiritual eye can only see when the eye of sense is closed. After the Reformation period the mystic tries to look with both eyes; his aim is to see God in all things, as well as all things in God. He returns with better resources to the task of the primitive religions, and tries to find spiritual law in the natural world. It is true that a strange crop of superstitions, the seeds of which had been sown long before, sprang up to mock his hopes. In necromancy, astrology, alchemy, palmistry, table-turning, and other delusions, we have what some count the essence, and others the reproach, of Mysticism. But these are, strictly speaking, scientific and not religious errors. From the standpoint of religion and philosophy, the important change is that, in the belief of these later mystics, the natural and the spiritual are, somehow or other, to be reconciled; the external world is no longer regarded as a place of exile from God, or as a delusive appearance; it is the living vesture of the Deity; and its \"discordant harmony,[364]\" though \"for the many it needs interpreters,[365]\" yet \"has a voice for the wise\" which speaks of things behind the veil. The glory of God is no longer figured as a blinding white light in which all colours are combined and lost; but is seen as a \"many-coloured wisdom[366]\" which shines everywhere, its varied hues appearing not only in the sanctuary of the lonely soul, but in all the wonders that science can discover, and all the beauties that art can interpret. Dualism, with the harsh asceticism which belongs to it, has given way to a brighter and more hopeful philosophy; men\\'s outlook upon the world is more intelligent, more trustful, and more genial; only for those who perversely seek to impose the ethics of selfish individualism upon a world which obeys no such law, science has in reserve a blacker pessimism than ever brooded over the ascetic of the cloister.',\n",
       " ' Is it not plain that the poet of Nature amid the Cumberland hills, the Spanish ascetic in his cell, and the Platonic philosopher in his library or lecture-room, have been climbing the same mountain from different sides? The paths are different, but the prospect from the summit is the same. It is idle to speak of collusion or insanity in the face of so great a cloud of witnesses divided by every circumstance of date, nationality, creed, education, and environment. The Carmelite friar had no interest in confirming the testimony of the Alexandrian professor; and no one has yet had the temerity to question the sanity of Wordsworth, or of Tennyson, whose description of the Vision in his \"Ancient Sage\" is now known to be a record of personal experience. These explorers of the high places of the spiritual life have only one thing in common--they have observed the conditions laid down once for all for the mystic in the 24th Psalm, \"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in His holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.\" The \"land which is very far off\" is always visible to those who have climbed the holy mountain. It may be scaled by the path of prayer and mortification, or by the path of devout study of God\\'s handiwork in Nature (and under this head I would wish to include not only the way traced out by Wordsworth, but that hitherto less trodden road which should lead the physicist to God); and, lastly, by the path of consecrated life in the great world, which, as it is the most exposed to temptations, is perhaps on that account the most blessed of the three.[389]',\n",
       " ' It would be possible to maintain that all our happiness consists in finding sympathies and affinities underlying apparent antagonisms, in bringing harmony out of discord, and order out of chaos. Even the lowest pleasures owe their attractiveness to a certain temporary correspondence between our desires and the nature of things. Selfishness itself, the prime source of sin, misery, and ignorance, cannot sever the ties which bind us to each other and to nature; or if it succeeds in doing so, it passes into madness, of which an experienced alienist has said, that its essence is \"concentrated egoism.\" Incidentally I may say that the peculiar happiness which accompanies every glimpse of insight into truth and reality, whether in the scientific, æsthetic, or emotional sphere, seems to me to have a greater apologetic value than has been generally recognised.

In Roman Catholic writers, \"mystical phenomena\" mean supernatural suspensions of physical law. Even those writers who have made a special study of the subject, show by their definitions of the word how uncertain is its connotation.[2] It is therefore necessary that I should make clear at the outset what I understand by the term, and what aspects of religious life and thought I intend to deal with in these Lectures.',\n",

Thou shalt be a god instead of a mortal\" ([Greek: olbie kai makariste theos d\\' esê anti brotoio]); \"Thou art a god instead of a wretched man\" ([Greek: theos ei eleeinou ex anthrôpou]).

This is the aim which I have kept in view in preparing this volume; and I should wish my book to be judged as a contribution to apologetics, rather than as a historical sketch of Christian Mysticism. I say this because I decided, after some hesitation, to adopt a historical framework for the Lectures, and this arrangement may cause my object to be misunderstood. It seemed to me that the instructiveness of tracing the development and operation of mystical ideas, in the forms which they have assumed as active forces in history, outweighed the disadvantage of appearing to waver between apology and narrative. A series of historical essays would, of course, have been quite unsuitable in the University pulpit, and, moreover, I did not approach the subject from that side. Until I began to prepare the Lectures, about a year and a half before they were delivered, my study of the mystical writers had been directed solely by my own intellectual and spiritual needs. I was attracted to them in the hope of finding in their writings a philosophy and a rule of life which would satisfy my mind and conscience. In this I was not disappointed; and thinking that others might perhaps profit by following the same path, I wished to put together and publish the results of my thought and reading. In such a scheme historical details are either out of place or of secondary value; and I hope this will be remembered by any historians who may take the trouble to read my book.',\n",

According to our translators, the Lover of the story is meant for Christ, and the Maiden for the Church. But the tendency of Catholic Mysticism has been to make the individual soul the bride of Christ, and to treat the Song of Solomon as symbolic of \"spiritual nuptials\" between Him and the individual \"contemplative.\" It is this latter notion, the growth of which I wish to trace.',\n",
       " ' The school of Eckhart[257] in the fourteenth century produced the brightest cluster of names in the history of Mysticism. In Ruysbroek, Suso, Tauler, and the author of the Theologia Germanica we see introspective Mysticism at its best. This must not be understood to mean that they improved upon the philosophical system of Eckhart, or that they are entirely free from the dangerous tendencies which have been found in his works. On the speculative side they added nothing of value, and none of them rivals Eckhart in clearness of intellect. But we find in them an unfaltering conviction that our communion with God must be a fact of experience, and not only a philosophical theory. With the most intense earnestness they set themselves to live through the mysteries of the spiritual life, as the only way to understand and prove them. Suso and Tauler both passed through deep waters; the history of their inner lives is a record of heroic struggle and suffering. The personality of the men is part of their message, a statement which could hardly be made of Dionysius or Erigena, perhaps not of Eckhart himself.',\n",
       " ' The task which now lies before me is to consider how far that type of religion and religious philosophy, which I tried in my last Lecture to depict in outline, is represented in and sanctioned by Holy Scripture. I shall devote most of my time to the New Testament, for we shall not find very much to help us in the Old. The Jewish mind and character, in spite of its deeply religious bent, was alien to Mysticism. In the first place, the religion of Israel, passing from what has been called Henotheism--the worship of a national God--to true Monotheism, always maintained a rigid notion of individuality, both human and Divine. Even prophecy, which is mystical in its essence, was in the early period conceived as unmystically as possible, Balaam is merely a mouthpiece of God; his message is external to his personality, which remains antagonistic to it. And, secondly, the Jewish doctrine of ideas was different from the Platonic. The Jew believed that the world, and the whole course of history, existed from all eternity in the mind of God, but as an unrealised purpose, which was actualised by degrees as the scroll of events was unfurled. There was no notion that the visible was in any way inferior to the invisible, or lacking in reality. Even in its later phases, after it had been partially Hellenised, Jewish idealism tended to crystallise as Chiliasm, or in \"Apocalypses,\" and not, like Platonism, in the dream of a perfect world existing \"yonder.\" In fact, the Jewish view of the external world was mainly that of naïve realism, but strongly pervaded by belief in an Almighty King and Judge. Moreover, the Jew had little sense of the Divine in nature: it was the power of God over nature which he was jealous to maintain. The majesty of the elemental forces was extolled in order to magnify the greater power of Him who made and could unmake them, and whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain. The weakness and insignificance of man, as contrasted with the tremendous power of God, is the reflection which the contemplation of nature generally produced in his mind. \"How can a man be just with God?\" asks Job; \"which removeth the mountains, and they know it not; when He overturneth them in His anger; which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble; which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, and sealeth up the stars.... He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, that we should come together in judgment. There is no daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.\" Nor does the answer that came to Job out of the whirlwind give any hint of a \"daysman\" betwixt man and God, but only enlarges on the presumption of man\\'s wishing to understand the counsels of the Almighty. Absolute submission to a law which is entirely outside of us and beyond our comprehension, is the final lesson of the book.[56] The nation exhibited the merits and defects of this type. On the one hand, it showed a deep sense of the supremacy of the moral law, and of personal responsibility; a stubborn independence and faith in its mission; and a strong national spirit, combined with vigorous individuality; but with these virtues went a tendency to externalise both religion and the ideal of well-being: the former became a matter of forms and ceremonies; the latter, of worldly possessions. It was only after the collapse of the national polity that these ideals became transmuted and spiritualised. Those disasters, which at first seemed to indicate a hopeless estrangement between God and His people, were the means of a deeper reconciliation. We can trace the process, from the old proverb that \"to see God is death,\" down to that remarkable passage in Jeremiah where the approaching advent, or rather restoration, of spiritual religion, is announced with all the solemnity due to so glorious a message. \"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.... After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord.[57]\" That this knowledge of God, and the assurance of blessedness which it brings, is the reward of righteousness and purity, is the chief message of the great prophets and psalmists. \"Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil, he shall dwell on high; his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given unto him; his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the King in His beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off.[58]\"',\n",
       " ' The worldliness and artificiality which set us out of tune with all this is worse than paganism.[385] Then this \"higher Pantheism\" developed into the sense of an all-pervading Personality, \"a soul that is the eternity of thought.\" And with this heightened consciousness of the nature of God came also a deeper knowledge of his own personality, a knowledge which he describes in true mystical language as a \"sinking into self from thought to thought.\" This may continue till man can at last \"breathe in worlds to which the heaven of heavens is but a veil,\" and perceive \"the forms whose kingdom is where time and space are not.\" These last lines describe a state analogous to the [Greek: opsis] of the Neoplatonists, and the excessus mentis of the Catholic mystics. At this advanced stage the priest of Nature may surrender himself to ecstasy without mistrust. Of such minds he says--',\n",
       " ' There are many other places where he describes this \"bliss ineffable,\" when \"all his thoughts were steeped in feeling,\" as he listened to the song which every form of creature sings \"as it looks towards the uncreated with a countenance of adoration and an eye of love,[387]\" that blessed mood--',\n",
       " ' This is not the keynote of the later Nature-Mysticism. We now expect that every new insight into the truth of things, every enlightenment of the eyes of our understanding, which may be granted us as the reward of faith, love, and purity of heart, will make the world around us appear, not viler and baser, but more glorious and more Divine. It is not a proof of spirituality, but of its opposite, if God\\'s world seems to us a poor place. If we could see it as God sees it, it would be still, as on the morning of creation, \"very good.\" The hymn which is ever ascending from the earth to the throne of God is to be listened for, that we may join in it. The laws by which all creation lives are to be studied, that we too may obey them. As for the beauty which is everywhere diffused so lavishly, it seems to be a gift of God\\'s pure bounty, to bring happiness to the unworldly souls who alone are able to see and enjoy it.',\n",
       " ' We have seen that Mysticism, like most other types of religion, had its cradle in the East. The Christian Platonists, whom we considered in the last Lecture, wrote in Greek, and we had no occasion to mention the Western Churches. But after the Pseudo-Dionysius, the East had little more to contribute to Christian thought. John of Damascus, in the eighth century, half mystic and half scholastic, need not detain us. The Eastern Churches rapidly sank into a deplorably barbarous condition, from which they have never emerged. We may therefore turn away from the Greek-speaking countries, and trace the course of Mysticism in the Latin and Teutonic races.',\n",
       " ' We have seen that the leaders of the Reformation in Germany thrust aside speculative Mysticism with impatience. Nor did Christian Platonism fare much better in the Latin countries. There were students of Plotinus in Italy in the sixteenth century, who fancied that a revival of humane letters, and a better acquaintance with philosophy, were the best means of combating the barbaric enthusiasms of the North. But these Italian Neoplatonists had, for the most part, no deep religious feelings, and they did not exhibit in their lives that severity which the Alexandrian philosophers had practised. And so, when Rome had need of a Catholic mystical revival to stem the tide of Protestantism, she could not find what she required among the scholars and philosophers of the Papal court. The Mysticism of the counter-Reformation had its centre in Spain.',\n",

       " '\"God is the Being of all that is.\" Since, then, Being is identical with God or Goodness, evil, as such, does not exist; it only exists by its participation in good. Evil, he says, is not in things which exist; a good tree cannot bear evil fruit; it must, therefore, have another origin. But this is dualism, and must be rejected.[163] Nor is evil in God, nor of God; nor in the angels; nor in the human soul; nor in the brutes; nor in inanimate nature; nor in matter. Having thus hunted evil out of every corner of the universe, he asks--Is evil, then, simply privation of good? But privation is not evil in itself. No; evil must arise from \"disorderly and inharmonious motion.\" As dirt has been defined as matter in the wrong place, so evil is good in the wrong place. It arises by a kind of accident; \"all evil is done with the object of gaining some good; no one does evil as evil.\" Evil in itself is that which is \"nohow, nowhere, and no thing\"; \"God sees evil as good.\" Students of modern philosophy will recognise a theory which has found influential advocates in our own day: that evil needs only to be supplemented, rearranged, and transmuted, in order to take its place in the universal harmony.[164]',\n",

I doubt sometimes, some of our dogmata and notions about justification may puff us up in far higher and goodlier conceits of ourselves than God hath of us, and that we profanely make the unspotted righteousness of Christ to serve only as a covering wherein to wrap our foul deformities and filthy vices, and when we have done, think ourselves in as good credit and repute with God as we are with ourselves, and that we are become Heaven\\'s darlings as much as we are our own.[363]\"',\n",

In this state a man can distinguish truth from falsehood, pure gold from base metal, in matters of belief; he can see the connexion of the various dogmas, and their harmony with reason; and in reading Scripture he can penetrate beneath the literal to the spiritual meaning. But when Clement speaks of reason or knowledge, he does not mean merely intellectual training. \"He who would enter the shrine must be pure,\" he says, \"and purity is to think holy things.\" And again, \"The more a man loves, the more deeply does he penetrate into God.\" Purity and love, to which he adds diligent study of the Scriptures, are all that is necessary to the highest life, though mental cultivation may be and ought to be a great help.[118]',\n",

Then came the temptation to be content with gradual progress, and to \"treat himself well.\" But \"the eternal Wisdom\" said to him, \"He who seeks with tender treatment to conquer a refractory body, wants common sense. If thou art minded to forsake all, do so to good purpose.\" The stern command was obeyed.[261] Very soon--it is the usual experience of ascetic mystics--he was encouraged by rapturous visions.

The Homeric hymn to Demeter insists only on ritual purity as the condition of salvation, and we hear that people trusted to the mystic baptism to wash out all their previous sins. Similarly the baptism of blood, the taurobolium, was supposed to secure eternal happiness, at any rate if death occurred within twenty years after the ceremony; when that interval had elapsed, it was common to renew the rite. (We find on inscriptions such phrases as \"arcanis perfusionibus in æternum renatus.\") So mechanical was the operation of the Mysteries supposed to be, that rites were performed for the dead (Plat. Rep. 364. St. Paul seems to refer to a similar custom in 1 Cor. xv. 29), and infants were appointed \"priests,\" and thoroughly initiated, that they might be clean from their \"original sin.\" Among the Gnostics, a favourite phrase was that initiation releases men \"from the fetters of fate and necessity\"; the gods of the intelligible world ([Greek: theoi noêtoi]) with whom we hold communion in the Mysteries being above \"fate.\"',\n",

The first is the philosophic side of Mysticism; the second, its religious side.

Tertullian, for instance, says calmly, \"The majority, almost, of men learn God from visions.[25]\" Such implicit reliance was placed on the Divine authority of visions, that on one occasion an ignorant peasant and a married man was made Patriarch of Alexandria against his will, because his dying predecessor had a vision that the man who should bring him a present of grapes on the next day should be his successor! In course of time visions became rarer among the laity, but continued frequent among the monks and clergy. And so the class which furnished most of the shining lights of Mysticism was that in which these experiences were most common.',\n",
       " 'After reading such maxims, we shall probably be inclined to think that \"the Infinite\" as a name for God might be given up with advantage. There is nothing Divine about a tabula rasa.]',\n",
       " 'Again and again she rings the changes on the words which the Lord said to her, \"I love thee and thou lovest Me, and our love shall never be disparted in two.\" \"The love wherein He made us was in Him from without beginning; in which love,\" she concludes, \"we have our beginning, and all this shall be seen in God without end.\"',\n",
       " 'All moral evil is caused either by ignorance or by weakness of will. The cure for the one is knowledge, the cure for the other is discipline.[119]',\n",
       " 'All things flow out from God, and all will ultimately return to Him. The first emanation is the Thing in itself ([Greek: auto to einai]), which corresponds to the Plotinian [Greek: Nous], and to the Johannine Logos. He also calls it \"Life in itself\" and \"Wisdom in itself\" ([Greek: autozôê, autosophia]). Of this he says, \"So then the Divine Wisdom in knowing itself will know all things. It will know the material immaterially, and the divided inseparably, and the many as one ([Greek: heniaiôs]), knowing all things by the standard of absolute unity.\" These important speculations are left undeveloped by Dionysius, who merely states them dogmatically. The universe is evolved from the Son, whom he identifies with the \"Thing in itself,\" \"Wisdom,\" or \"Life in itself.\" In creation \"the One is said to become multiform.\" The world is a necessary process of God\\'s being. He created it \"as the sun shines,\" \"without premeditation or purpose.\" The Father is simply One; the Son has also plurality, namely, the words (or reasons) which make existence ([Greek: tous ousiopoious logous]), which theology calls fore-ordinations ([Greek: proorismous]). But he does not teach that all separate existences will ultimately be merged in the One. The highest Unity gives to all the power of striving, on the one hand, to share in the One; on the other, to persist in their own individuality. And in more than one passage he speaks of God as a Unity comprehending, not abolishing differences.[165] \"God is before all things\"; \"Being is in Him, and He is not in Being.\" Thus Dionysius tries to safeguard the transcendence of God, and to escape Pantheism. The outflowing process is appropriated by the mind by the positive method--the downward path through finite existences: its conclusion is, \"God is All.\" The return journey is by the negative road, that of ascent to God by abstraction and analysis: its conclusion is, \"All is not God.[166]\" The negative path is the high road of a large school of mystics; I will say more about it presently. The mystic, says Dionysius, \"must leave behind all things both in the sensible and in the intelligible worlds, till he enters into the darkness of nescience that is truly mystical.\" This \"Divine darkness,\" he says elsewhere, \"is the light unapproachable\" mentioned by St. Paul, \"a deep but dazzling darkness,\" as Henry Vaughan calls it. It is dark through excess of light[167]. This doctrine really renders nugatory what he has said about the persistence of distinctions after the restitution of all things; for as \"all colours agree in the dark,\" so, for us, in proportion as we attain to true knowledge, all distinctions are lost in the absolute.',\n",
       " 'Alternations of mirth and sadness followed each other many times, \"to learn me that it is speedful to some souls to feel on this wise.\" Once especially she was left to herself, \"in heaviness and weariness of my life, and irksomeness of myself, that scarcely I could have pleasure to live.... For profit of a man\\'s soul he is sometimes left to himself; although sin is not always the cause; for in that time I sinned not, wherefore I should be so left to myself; for it was so sudden. Also, I deserved not to have this blessed feeling. But freely our Lord giveth when He will, and suffereth us to be in woe sometime. And both is one love.\"',\n",
       " 'Another mystical idea, which is never absent from the mind of St. Paul, is that the individual Christian must live through, and experience personally, the redemptive process of Christ. The life, death, and resurrection of Christ were for him the revelation of a law, the law of redemption through suffering. The victory over sin and death was won for us; but it must also be won in us. The process is an universal law, not a mere event in the past.[81] It has been exemplified in history, which is a progressive unfurling or revelation of a great mystery, the meaning of which is now at last made plain in Christ.[82] And it must also appear in each human life. \"We were buried with Him,\" says St. Paul to the Romans,[83] \"through baptism into death,\" \"that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.\" And again,[84] \"If the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ Jesus from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies through His Spirit that dwelleth in you.\" And, \"If ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above.[85]\"',\n",
       " 'Another poor and question-begging definition, on the same lines as the last.',\n",
       " 'Another time he saw a vision of angels, and besought one of them to show him the manner of God\\'s secret dwelling in the soul. An angel answered, \"Cast then a joyous glance into thyself, and see how God plays His play of love with thy loving soul.\" He looked immediately, and saw that his body over his heart was as clear as crystal, and that in the centre was sitting tranquilly, in lovely form, the eternal Wisdom, beside whom sat, full of heavenly longing, the servitor\\'s own soul, which leaning lovingly towards God\\'s side, and encircled by His arms, lay pressed close to His heart.',\n",
       " 'As to the means by which this union is manifested to the consciousness, there is no doubt that very many mystics believed in, and looked for, ecstatic revelations, trances, or visions. This, again, is one of the crucial questions of Mysticism.',\n",
       " 'At this season there came into his soul a flame of intense fire, which made his heart burn with Divine love. And as a \"love token,\" he cut deep in his breast the name of Jesus, so that the marks of the letters remained all his life, \"about the length of a finger-joint.\"',\n",
       " 'Before considering these statements, I will quote from another attack upon Mysticism by a writer whose general views are very similar to those of Harnack.',\n",
       " 'Beginning with the Trinity, he identifies God the Father with the Neoplatonic Monad, and describes Him as \"superessential Indetermination,\" \"super-rational Unity,\" \"the Unity which unifies every unity,\" \"superessential Essence,\" \"irrational Mind,\" \"unspoken Word,\" \"the absolute No-thing which is above all existence.[161]\" Even now he is not satisfied with the tortures to which he has subjected the Greek language. \"No monad or triad,\" he says, \"can express the all-transcending hiddenness of the all-transcending super-essentially super-existing super-Deity.[162]\" But even in the midst of this barbarous jargon he does not quite forget his Plato. \"The Good and Beautiful,\" he says, \"are the cause of all things that are; and all things love and aspire to the Good and Beautiful, which are, indeed, the sole objects of their desire.\" \"Since, then, the Absolute Good and Beautiful is honoured by eliminating all qualities from it, the non-existent also ([Greek: to mê on]) must participate in the Good and Beautiful.\" This pathetic absurdity shows what we are driven to if we try to graft Indian nihilism upon the Platonic doctrine of ideas. Plotinus tried hard to show that his First Person was very different from his lowest category--non-existent \"matter\"; but if we once allow ourselves to define the Infinite as the Indefinite, the conclusion which he deprecated cannot long be averted.',\n",
       " 'Bernard\\'s homilies on the Song of Solomon gave a great impetus to this mode of symbolism; but even he says that the Church and not the individual is the bride of Christ. There is no doubt that the enforced celibacy and virginity of the monks and nuns led them, consciously or unconsciously, to transfer to the human person of Christ (and to a much slighter extent, to the Virgin Mary) a measure of those feelings which could find no vent in their external lives. We can trace this, in a wholesome and innocuous form, in the visions of Juliana of Norwich. Quotations from Ruysbroek\\'s Spiritual Nuptials, and from Suso, bearing on the same point, are given in the body of the Lectures. Good specimens of devotional poetry of this type might be selected from Crashaw and Quarles. (A few specimens are included in Palgrave\\'s Golden Treasury of Sacred Song.) Fénelon\\'s language on the subject is not quite so pleasing; it breathes more of sentimentality than of reverence. The contemplative, he says, desires \"une simple présence de Dieu purement amoureuse,\" and speaks to Christ always \"comme l\\'épouse à l\\'époux.\"',\n",
       " 'Between the two ideas of essentialisation and of substitution comes that of gradual transformation, which, again, cannot in history be separated from the other two. It has the obvious advantage of not regarding deification as an opus operatum, but as a process, as a hope rather than a fact. A favourite maxim with mystics who thought thus, was that \"love changes the lover into the beloved.\" Louis of Granada often recurs to this thought.',\n",
       " 'Bonaventura resembles Albertus in reverting more decidedly than the Victorines to the Dionysian tradition. He expatiates on the passivity and nakedness of the soul which is necessary in order to enter into the Divine darkness, and elaborates with tiresome pedantry his arbitrary schemes of faculties and stages. However, he gains something by his knowledge of Aristotle, which he uses to correct the Neoplatonic doctrine of God as abstract Unity. \"God is \\'ideo omnimodum,\\'\" he says finely, \"quia summe unum.\" He is \"totum intra omnia et totum extra\"--a succinct statement that God is both immanent and transcendent. His proof of the Trinity is original and profound. It is the nature of the Good to impart itself, and so the highest Good must be \"summe diffusivum sui,\" which can only be in hypostatic union.',\n",
       " 'But I do not think that the negative road is a pure error. There is a negative side in religion, both in thought and practice. We are first impelled to seek the Infinite by the limitations of the finite, which appear to the soul as bonds and prison walls. It is natural first to think of the Infinite as that in which these barriers are done away. And in practice we must die daily, if our inward man is to be daily renewed. We must die to our lower self, not once only but continually, so that we may rise on stepping stones of many dead selves to higher things.[178] We must die to our first superficial views of the world around us, nay, even to our first views of God and religion, unless the childlike in our faith is by arrest of growth to become the childish. All the good things of life have first to be renounced, and then given back to us, before they can be really ours. It was necessary that these truths should be not only taught, but lived through. The individual has generally to pass through the quagmire of the \"everlasting No,\" before he can set his feet on firm ground; and the Christian races, it seems, were obliged to go through the same experience. Moreover, there is a sense in which all moral effort aims at destroying the conditions of its own existence, and so ends logically in self-negation. Our highest aim as regards ourselves is to eradicate, not only sin, but temptation. We do not feel that we have won the victory until we no longer wish to offend. But a being who was entirely free from temptation would be either more or less than a man--\"either a beast or a God,\" as Aristotle says.[179] There is, therefore, a half truth in the theory that the goal of earthly striving is negation and absorption. But it at once becomes false if we forget that it is a goal which cannot be reached in time, and which is achieved, not by good and evil neutralising each other, but by death being swallowed up in victory. If morality ceases to be moral when it has achieved its goal, it must pass into something which includes as well as transcends it--a condition which is certainly not fulfilled by contemplative passivity.[180]',\n",
       " 'But in Plotinus, as in his Christian imitators, they do not part company. The \"marching orders\" of the true mystic are those given by God to Moses on Sinai, \"See that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount.[143]\" But Plotinus teaches that, as the sensible world is a shadow of the intelligible, so is action a shadow of contemplation, suited to weak-minded persons.[144] This is turning the tables on the \"man of action\" in good earnest; but it is false Platonism and false Mysticism. It leads to the heartless doctrine, quite unworthy of the man, that public calamities are to the wise man only stage tragedies--or even stage comedies.[145] The moral results of this self-centred individualism are exemplified by the mediæval saint and visionary, Angela of Foligno, who congratulates herself on the deaths of her mother, husband, and children, \"who were great obstacles in the way of God.\"',\n",
       " 'But instead of following any further the course of mystical theology in Germany, I wish to turn for a few minutes to our own country. I am the more ready to do so, because I have come across the statement, repeated in many books, that England has been a barren field for mystics. It is assumed that the English character is alien to Mysticism--that we have no sympathy, as a nation, for this kind of religion. Some writers hint that it is because we are too practical, and have too much common sense. The facts do not bear out this view. There is no race, I think, in which there is a richer vein of idealism, and a deeper sense of the mystery of life, than our own. In a later Lecture I hope to illustrate this statement from our national poetry. Here I wish to insist that even the Mysticism of the cloister, which is the least satisfying to the energetic and independent spirit of our countrymen, might be thoroughly and adequately studied from the works of English mystics alone. I will give two examples of this mediæval type. Both of them lived before the Reformation, near the end of the fourteenth century; but in them, as in Tauler, we find very few traces of Romish error.',\n",
       " 'But it held sway for a long time--so long that we cannot complain if many have said, \"This is the essence of Mysticism.\" Mysticism is such a vague word, that one must not quarrel with any \"private interpretation\" of it; but we must point out that this limitation excludes the whole army of symbolists, a school which, in Europe at least, has shown more vitality than introspective Mysticism. I regard the via negativa in metaphysics, religion, and ethics as the great accident of Christian Mysticism. The break-up of the ancient civilisation, with the losses and miseries which it brought upon humanity, and the chaos of brutal barbarism in which Europe weltered for some centuries, caused a widespread pessimism and world-weariness which is foreign to the temper of Europe, and which gave way to energetic and full-blooded activity in the Renaissance and Reformation. Asiatic Mysticism is the natural refuge of men who have lost faith in civilisation, but will not give up faith in God. \"Let us fly hence to our dear country!\" We hear the words already in Plotinus--nay, even in Plato. The sun still shone in heaven, but on earth he was eclipsed. Mysticism cuts too deep to allow us to live comfortably on the surface of life; and so all \"the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible world\" pressed upon men and women till they were fain to throw it off, and seek peace in an invisible world of which they could not see even a shadow round about them.',\n",
       " 'But it is possible to save personality without regarding the human spirit as a monad, independent and sharply separated from other spirits. Distinction, not separation, is the mark of personality; but it is separation, not distinction, that forbids union. The error, according to the mystic\\'s psychology, is in regarding consciousness of self as the measure of personality. The depths of personality are unfathomable, as Heraclitus already knew;[48] the light of consciousness only plays on the surface of the waters. Jean Paul Richter is a true exponent of this characteristic doctrine when he says, \"We attribute far too small dimensions to the rich empire of ourself, if we omit from it the unconscious region which resembles a great dark continent. The world which our memory peoples only reveals, in its revolution, a few luminous points at a time, while its immense and teeming mass remains in shade.... We daily see the conscious passing into unconsciousness; and take no notice of the bass accompaniment which our fingers continue to play, while our attention is directed to fresh musical effects.[49]\" So far is it from being true that the self of our immediate consciousness is our true personality, that we can only attain personality, as spiritual and rational beings, by passing beyond the limits which mark us off as separate individuals. Separate individuality, we may say, is the bar which prevents us from realising our true privileges as persons.[50] And so the mystic interprets very literally that maxim of our Lord, in which many have found the fundamental secret of Christianity: \"He that will save his life--his soul, his personality--shall lose it; and he that will lose his life for My sake shall find it.\" The false self must die--nay, must \"die daily,\" for the process is gradual, and there is no limit to it. It is a process of infinite expansion--of realising new correspondences, new sympathies and affinities with the not-ourselves, which affinities condition, and in conditioning constitute, our true life as persons. The paradox is offensive only to formal logic. As a matter of experience, no one, I imagine, would maintain that the man who has practically realised, to the fullest possible extent, the common life which he draws from his Creator, and shares with all other created beings,--so realised it, I mean, as to draw from that consciousness all the influences which can play upon him from outside,--has thereby dissipated and lost his personality, and become less of a person than another who has built a wall round his individuality, and lived, as Plato says, the life of a shell-fish.[51]',\n",
       " 'But natural religion is not to be identified with Mysticism, and it would not further our present inquiry to collect passages, in prose or poetry, which illustrate the aids to faith which the book of Nature may supply. Nor need we dwell on such pure Platonism as we find in Spenser\\'s \"Hymn of Heavenly Beauty,\" or some of Shelley\\'s poems, in which we are bidden to gaze upon the world as a mirror of the Divine Beauty, since our mortal sight cannot endure the \"white radiance\" of the eternal archetypes.[370] We have seen how this view of the world as a pale reflection of the Ideas leads in practice to a contempt for visible things; as, indeed, it does in Spenser\\'s beautiful poem. He invites us, after learning Nature\\'s lessons, to',\n",
       " 'But the process of deification may be conceived of in two ways: (a) as essentialisation, (b) as substitution. The former may perhaps be called the more philosophical conception, the latter the more religious. The former lays stress on the high calling of man, and his potential greatness as the image of God; the latter, on his present misery and alienation, and his need of redemption. The former was the teaching of the Neoplatonic philosophy, in which the human mind was the throne of the Godhead; the latter was the doctrine of the Mysteries, in which salvation was conceived of realistically as something imparted or infused.',\n",
       " \"But this kind of humanism was frowned upon by the Church, in Spain as elsewhere. These were not the weapons with which Lutheranism could be fought successfully. Juan d'Avila was accused before the Inquisition in 1534, and one of his books was placed on the Index of 1559; Louis de Granada had to take refuge in Portugal; Louis de Leon, who had the courage to say that the Song of Solomon is only a pastoral idyll, was sent to a dungeon for five years.[293] Even St. Teresa narrowly escaped imprisonment at Seville; and St. Juan of the Cross passed nine months in a black hole at Toledo.\",\n",
       " 'But we are concerned with thaumaturgy only so far as it has affected Mysticism. At first sight the connexion may seem very slight; and slight indeed it is. But just as Mysticism of the subjective type is often entangled in theories which sublimate matter till only a vain shadow remains, so objective Mysticism has been often pervaded by another kind of false spiritualism--that which finds edification in palpable supernatural manifestations. These so-called \"mystical phenomena\" are so much identified with \"Mysticism\" in the Roman Catholic Church of to-day, that the standard treatises on the subject, now studied in continental universities, largely consist of grotesque legends of \"levitation,\" \"bilocation,\" \"incandescence,\" \"radiation,\" and other miraculous tokens of Divine favour[334]. The great work of Görres, in five volumes, is divided into Divine, Natural, and Diabolical Mysticism. The first contains stories of the miraculous enhancement of sight, hearing, smell, and so forth, which results from extreme holiness; and tells us how one saint had the power of becoming invisible, another of walking through closed doors, and a third of flying through the air. \"Natural Mysticism\" deals with divination, lycanthropy, vampires, second sight, and other barbarous superstitions. \"Diabolical Mysticism\" includes witchcraft, diabolical possession, and the hideous stories of incubi and succubæ. It is not my intention to say any more about these savage survivals, as I do not wish to bring my subject into undeserved contempt[335]. \"These terrors, and this darkness of the mind,\" as Lucretius says, \"must be dispelled, not by the bright shafts of the sun\\'s light, but by the study of Nature\\'s laws[336].\"',\n",
       " 'But we do not find that the masters of the spiritual life attached very much importance to them, or often appealed to them as aids to faith.[26] As a rule, visions were regarded as special rewards bestowed by the goodness of God on the struggling saint, and especially on the beginner, to refresh him and strengthen him in the hour of need. Very earnest cautions were issued that no efforts must be made to induce them artificially, and aspirants were exhorted neither to desire them, nor to feel pride in having seen them. The spiritual guides of the Middle Ages were well aware that such experiences often come of disordered nerves and weakened digestion; they believed also that they are sometimes delusions of Satan. Richard of St. Victor says, \"As Christ attested His transfiguration by the presence of Moses and Elias, so visions should not be believed unless they have the authority of Scripture.\" Albertus Magnus tries to classify them, and says that those which contain a sensuous element are always dangerous. Eckhart is still more cautious, and Tauler attaches little value to them. Avila, the Spanish mystic, says that only those visions which minister to our spiritual necessities, and make us more humble, are genuine. Self-induced visions inflate us with pride, and do irreparable injury to health of mind and body.[27]',\n",
       " 'But we shall handle our subject very inadequately if we consider only the symbolical value which may be attached to external objects. Our thoughts and beliefs about the spiritual world, so far as they are conceived under forms, or expressed in language, which belong properly only to things of time and space, are of the nature of symbols. In this sense it has been said that the greater part of dogmatic theology is the dialectical development of mystical symbols. For instance, the paternal relation of the First Person of the Trinity to the Second is a symbol; and the representation of eternity as an endless period of time stretching into futurity, is a symbol. We believe that the forms under which it is natural and necessary for us to conceive of transcendental truths have a real and vital relation to the ideas which they attempt to express; but their inadequacy is manifest if we treat them as facts of the same order as natural phenomena, and try to intercalate them, as is too often done, among the materials with which an abstract science has to deal.',\n",
       " 'But what is most distinctive in Eckhart\\'s ethics is the new importance which is given to the doctrine of immanence. The human soul is a microcosm, which in a manner contains all things in itself. At the \"apex of the mind\" there is a Divine \"spark,\" which is so closely akin to God that it is one with Him, and not merely united to Him.[246] In his teaching about this \"ground of the soul\" Eckhart wavers. His earlier view is that it is created, and only the medium by which God transforms us to Himself. But his later doctrine is that it is uncreated, the immanence of the Being and Nature of God Himself. \"Diess Fünkelein, das ist Gott,\" he says once. This view was adopted by Ruysbroek, Suso, and (with modifications by) Tauler, and became one of their chief tenets.[247] This spark is the organ by which our personality holds communion with God and knows Him. It is with reference to it that Eckhart uses the phrase which has so often been quoted to convict him of blasphemous self-deification--\"the eye with which I see God is the same as that with which He sees me.[248]\" The \"uncreated spark\" is really the same as the grace of God, which raises us into a Godlike state. But this grace, according to Eckhart (at least in his later period), is God Himself acting like a human faculty in the soul, and transforming it so that \"man himself becomes grace.\"',\n",
       " \"But when this comforting and inspiring thought is made to form the basis of a new Chiliasm--a belief in a millennium of perfected humanity on this earth, and when this belief is substituted for the Christian belief in an eternal life beyond our bourne of time and place, it is necessary to protest that this belief entirely fails to satisfy the legitimate hopes of the human race, that it is bad philosophy, and that it is flatly contrary to what science tells us of the destiny of the world and of mankind. The human spirit beats against the bars of space and time themselves, and could never be satisfied with any earthly utopia. Our true home must be in some higher sphere of existence, above the contradictions which make it impossible for us to believe that time and space are ultimate realities, and out of reach of the inevitable catastrophe which the next glacial age must bring upon the human race.[406] This world of space and time is to resemble heaven as far as it can; but a fixed limit is set to the amount of the Divine plan which can be realised under these conditions. Our hearts tell us of a higher form of existence, in which the doom of death is not merely deferred but abolished. This eternal world we here see through a glass darkly: at best we can apprehend but the outskirts of God's ways, and hear a small whisper of His voice; but our conviction is that, though our earthly house be dissolved (as dissolved it must be), we have a home not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. In this hope we may include all creation; and trust that in some way neither more nor less incomprehensible than the deliverance which we expect for ourselves, all God's creatures, according to their several capacities, may be set free from the bondage of corruption and participate in the final triumph over death and sin. Most firmly do I believe that this faith in immortality, though formless and inpalpable as the air we breathe, and incapable of definite presentation except under inadequate and self-contradictory symbols, is nevertheless enthroned in the centre of our being, and that those who have steadily set their affections on things above, and lived the risen life even on earth, receive in themselves an assurance which robs death of its sting, and is an earnest of a final victory over the grave.\",\n",
       " 'Böhme professed to write only what he had \"seen\" by Divine illumination. His visions are not (with insignificant exceptions) authenticated by any marvellous signs; he simply asserts that he has been allowed to see into the heart of things, and that the very Being of God has been laid open to his spiritual sight.[348] His was that type of mind to which every thought becomes an image, and a logical process is like an animated photograph. \"I am myself my own book,\" he says; and in writing, he tries to transcribe on paper the images which float before his mind\\'s eye. If he fails, it is because he cannot find words to describe what he is seeing. Böhme was an unlearned man; but when he is content to describe his visions in homely German, he is lucid enough. Unfortunately, the scholars who soon gathered round him supplied him with philosophical terms, which he forthwith either personified--for instance the word \"Idea\" called forth the image of a beautiful maiden--or used in a sense of his own. The study of Paracelsus obscured his style still more, filling his treatises with a bewildering mixture of theosophy and chemistry. The result is certainly that much of his work is almost unreadable; the nuggets of gold have to be dug out from a bed of rugged stone; and we cannot be surprised that the unmystical eighteenth century declared that \"Behmen\\'s works would disgrace Bedlam at full moon.[349]\" But German philosophers have spoken with reverence of \"the father of Protestant Mysticism,\" who \"perhaps only wanted learning and the gift of clear expression to become a German Plato\"; and Sir Isaac Newton shut himself up for three months to study Böhme, whose teaching on attraction and the laws of motion seemed to him to have great value.[350]',\n",
       " 'Böhme was born in 1575 near Görlitz, where he afterwards settled as a shoemaker and glover. He began to write in 1612, and in spite of clerical opposition, which silenced him for five years, he produced a number of treatises between that date and his death in 1624.',\n",
       " 'Böhme\\'s doctrine of God and the world resembles that of other speculative mystics, but he contributes a new element in the great stress which he lays on antithesis as a law of being. \"In Yes and No all things consist,\" he says. No philosopher since Heraclitus and Empedocles had asserted so strongly that \"Strife is the father of all things.\" Even in the hidden life of the unmanifested Godhead he finds the play of Attraction and Diffusion, the resultant of which is a Desire for manifestation felt in the Godhead. As feeling this desire, the Godhead becomes \"Darkness\"; the light which illumines the darkness is the Son. The resultant is the Holy Spirit, in whom arise the archetypes of creation. So he explains Body, Soul, and Spirit as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis; and the same formula serves to explain Good, Evil, and Free Will; Angels, Devils, and the World. His view of Evil is not very consistent; but his final doctrine is that the object of the cosmic process is to exhibit the victory of Good over Evil, of Love over Hatred.[351] He at least has the merit of showing that strife is so inwoven with our lives here that we cannot possibly soar above the conflict between Good and Evil. It must be observed that Böhme repudiated the doctrine that there is any evolution of God in time. \"I say not that Nature is God,\" he says: \"He Himself is all, and communicates His power to all His works.\" But the creation of the archetypes was not a temporal act.',\n",

God created the world, not out of nothing, nor out of something, but out of Himself.[217] The creatures have always pre-existed \"yonder\" in the Word; God has only caused them to be realised in time and space.',\n",
       " 'Dionysius has much to say about love[169], but he uses the word [Greek: erôs], which is carefully avoided in the New Testament. He admits that the Scriptures \"often use\" [Greek: agapê], but justifies his preference for the other word by quoting St. Ignatius, who says of Christ, \"My Love [Greek: erôs] is crucified.[170]\" Divine Love, he finely says, is \"an eternal circle, from goodness, through goodness, and to goodness.\"',\n",
       " 'Dionysius is a theologian, not a visionary like his master Hierotheus. His main object is to present Christianity in the guise of a Platonic mysteriosophy, and he uses the technical terms of the mysteries whenever he can.[160] His philosophy is that of his day--the later Neoplatonism, with its strong Oriental affinities.',\n",
       " 'Eckhart distinguishes between \"the Godhead\" and \"God.\" The Godhead is the abiding potentiality of Being, containing within Himself all distinctions, as yet undeveloped. He therefore cannot be the object of knowledge, nor of worship, being \"Darkness\" and \"Formlessness.[238]\" The Triune God is evolved from the Godhead. The Son is the Word of the Father, His uttered thought; and the Holy Ghost is \"the Flower of the Divine Tree,\" the mutual love which unites the Father and the Son. Eckhart quotes the words which St. Augustine makes Christ say of Himself: \"I am come as a Word from the heart, as a ray from the sun, as heat from the fire, as fragrance from the flower, as a stream from a perennial fountain.\" He insists that the generation of the Son is a continual process.',\n",
       " 'Eckhart gives to \"the highest reason[250]\" the primacy among our faculties, and in his earlier period identifies it with \"the spark.\" He asserts the absolute supremacy of reason more strongly than anyone since Erigena. His language on this subject resembles that of the Cambridge Platonists. \"Reasonable knowledge is eternal life,\" he says. \"How can any external revelation help me,\" he asks, \"unless it be verified by inner experience? The last appeal must always be to the deepest part of my own being, and that is my reason.\" \"The reason,\" he says, \"presses ever upwards. It cannot rest content with goodness or wisdom, nor even with God Himself; it must penetrate to the Ground from whence all goodness and wisdom spring.\"',\n",
       " 'Eckhart wrote in German; that is to say, he wrote for the public, and not for the learned only. His desire to be intelligible to the general reader led him to adopt an epigrammatic antithetic style, and to omit qualifying phrases. This is one reason why he laid himself open to so many accusations of heresy.[237]',\n",
       " 'Ecstasy or vision begins when thought ceases, to our consciousness, to proceed from ourselves. It differs from dreaming, because the subject is awake. It differs from hallucination, because there is no organic disturbance: it is, or claims to be, a temporary enhancement, not a partial disintegration, of the mental faculties. Lastly, it differs from poetical inspiration, because the imagination is passive.',\n",
       " 'Erigena is an admirable interpreter of the Alexandrians and of Dionysius, but he emphasises their most dangerous tendencies. We cannot be surprised that his books were condemned; it is more strange that the audacious theories which they repeat from Dionysius should have been allowed to pass without censure for so long. Indeed, the freedom of speculation accorded to the mystics forms a remarkable exception to the zeal for exact orthodoxy which characterised the general policy of the early Church. The explanation is that in the East Mysticism has seldom been revolutionary, and has compensated for its speculative audacity by the readiness of its outward conformity. Moreover, the theories of Dionysius about the earthly and heavenly hierarchies were by no means unwelcome to sacerdotalism. In the West things were different. Mysticism there has always been a spirit of reform, generally of revolt. There is much even in Erigena, whose main affinities were with the East, which forecasts the Reformation. He is the father, not only of Western Mysticism and scholasticism, but of rationalism as well.[218] But the danger which lurked in his speculations was not at first recognised. His book on predestination was condemned in 855 and 859 for its universalist doctrine,[219] and two hundred years later his Eucharistic doctrine, revived by Berengar, was censured.[220] But it was not till the thirteenth century that a general condemnation was passed upon him. This judgment followed the appearance of a strongly pantheistic or acosmistic school of mystics, chief among whom was Amalric of Bena, a master of theology at Paris about 1200. Amalric is a very interesting figure, for his teaching exhibits all the features which are most characteristic of extravagant Mysticism in the West--its strong belief in Divine immanence, not only in the Church, but in the individual; its uncompromising rationalism, contempt for ecclesiastical forms, and tendency to evolutionary optimism. Among the doctrines attributed to Amalric and his followers are a pantheistic identification of man with God, and a negation of matter; they were said to teach that unconsecrated bread was the body of Christ, and that God spoke through Ovid (a curious choice!), as well as through St. Augustine. They denied the resurrection of the body, and the traditional eschatology, saying that \"he who has the knowledge of God in himself has paradise within him.\" They insisted on a progressive historical revelation--the reign of the Father began with Abraham, that of the Son with Christ, that of the Spirit with themselves. They despised sacraments, believing that the Spirit works without means. They taught that he who lives in love can do no wrong, and were suspected, probably truly, of the licentious conduct which naturally follows from such a doctrine. This antinomianism is no part of true Mysticism; but it is often found in conjunction with mystical speculation among the half-educated. It is the vulgar perversion of Plotinus\\' doctrine that matter is nothing, and that the highest part of our nature can take no stain.[221] We find evidence of immorality practised \"in nomine caritatis\" among the Gnostics and Manicheans of the first centuries, and these heresies never really became extinct. The sects of the \"Free Spirit,\" who flourished later in the thirteenth century, had an even worse reputation than the Amalricians. They combined with their Pantheism a Determinism which destroyed all sense of responsibility. On the other hand, the followers of Ortlieb of Strassburg, about the same period, advocated an extreme asceticism based on a dualistic or Manichean view of the world; and they combined with this error an extreme rationalism, teaching that the historical Christ was a mere man; that the Gospel history has only a symbolical truth; that the soul only, without the body, is immortal; and that the Pope and his priests are servants of Satan.',\n",
       " 'Erigena says that God is above all the categories, including that of relation. It follows that the Persons of the Trinity, which are only \"relative names,\" are fused in the Absolute.[215] We may make statements about God, if we remember that they are only metaphors; but whatever we deny about Him, we deny truly.[216] This is the \"negative road\" of Dionysius, from whom Erigena borrows a number of uncouth compounds. But we can see that he valued this method mainly as safeguarding the transcendence of God against pantheistic theories of immanence. The religious and practical aspects of the doctrine had little interest for him.',\n",
       " 'Erotic Mysticism is no part of Platonism. That \"sensuous love of the unseen\" (as Pater calls it), which the Platonist often seems to aim at, has more of admiration and less of tenderness than the emotion which we have now to consider. The notion of a spiritual marriage between God and the soul seems to have come from the Greek Mysteries, through the Alexandrian Jews and Gnostics. Representations of \"marriages of gods\" were common at the Mysteries, especially at those of the least reputable kind (cf. Lucian, Alexander, 38). In other instances the ceremony of initiation was made to resemble a marriage, and the [Greek: mystês] was greeted with the words [Greek: chaire, nymphie]. And among the Jews of the first century there existed a system of Mysteries, probably copied from Eleusis. They had their greater and their lesser Mysteries, and we hear that among their secret doctrines was \"marriage with God.\" In Philo we find strange and fantastic speculations on this subject. For instance, he argues that as the Bible does not mention Abraham, Jacob, and Moses as [Greek: gnôrizontas tas gynaikas], we are meant to believe that their children were not born naturally. But he allegorises the women of the Pentateuch in such a way ([Greek: logô men eisi gynaikes, ergô de aretai]) that it is difficult to say what he wishes us to believe in a literal sense. The Valentinian Gnostics seem to have talked much of \"spiritual marriage,\" and it was from them that Origen got the idea of elaborating the conception. But, curiously enough, it is Tertullian who first argues that the body as well as the soul is the bride of Christ. \"If the soul is the bride,\" he says, \"the flesh is the dowry\" (de Resurr. 63). Origen, however, really began the mischief in his homilies and commentary on the Song of Solomon. The prologue of the commentary in Rufinus commences as follows: \"Epithalamium libellus hic, id est nuptiale carmen, dramatis in modum mihi videtur a Salomone conscriptus, quem cecinit instar nubentis sponsæ, et erga sponsum suum qui est sermo Dei cælesti amore flagrantis. Adamavit enim eum sive anima, quæ ad imaginem eius facta est, sive ecclesia.\" Harnack says that Gregory of Nyssa exhibits the conception in its purest and most attractive form in the East, and adds, \"We can point to very few Greek Fathers in whom the figure does not occur.\" (There is a learned note on the subject by Louis de Leon, which corroborates this statement of Harnack. He refers to Chrysostom, Theodoret, Irenæus, Hilary, Cyprian, Augustine, Tertullian, Ignatius, Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril, Leo, Photius, and Theophylact as calling Christ the bridegroom of souls.) In the West, we find it in Ambrose, less prominently in Augustine and Jerome. Dionysius seizes on the phrase of Ignatius, \"My love has been crucified,\" to justify erotic imagery in devotional writing.',\n",
       " 'Especially interesting from the point of view of our present task is the use of mystery-language which we find everywhere in Clement. The Christian revelation is \"the Divine (or holy) mysteries,\" \"the Divine secrets,\" \"the secret Word,\" \"the mysteries of the Word\"; Jesus Christ is \"the Teacher of the Divine mysteries\"; the ordinary teaching of the Church is \"the lesser mysteries\"; the higher knowledge of the Gnostic, leading to full initiation ([Greek: epopteia]) \"the great mysteries.\" He borrows verbatim from a Neopythagorean document a whole sentence, to the effect that \"it is not lawful to reveal to profane persons the mysteries of the Word\"--the \"Logos\" taking the place of \"the Eleusinian goddesses.\" This evident wish to claim the Greek mystery-worship, with its technical language, for Christianity, is very interesting, and the attempt was by no means unfruitful. Among other ideas which seem to come direct from the mysteries is the notion of deification by the gift of immortality. Clement[120] says categorically, [Greek: to mê phtheiresthai theiotêtos metechein esti]. This is, historically, the way in which the doctrine of \"deification\" found its way into the scheme of Christian Mysticism. The idea of immortality as the attribute constituting Godhead was, of course, as familiar to the Greeks as it was strange to the Jews.[121]',\n",
       " 'Eternity is, for Tauler, \"the everlasting Now\"; but in his popular discourses he uses the ordinary expressions about future reward and punishment, even about hell fire; though his deeper thought is that the hopeless estrangement of the soul from God is the source of all the torments of the lost.',\n",
       " \"Everything spiritual is indestructible; and therefore every spirit must at last return to the Good. For the Good alone exists; evil has no existence, no substance. This is a doctrine which we shall meet with again. Man, he expressly asserts, cannot be consubstantial with God, for man can change, while God is immutable. He does not see, apparently, that, from the point of view of the Platonist, his universalism makes man's freedom to change an illusion, as belonging to time only and not to eternity.\",\n",
       " 'Evil has no substance, and is destined to disappear. \"Nothing contrary to the Divine goodness and life and blessedness can be coeternal with them.\" The world must reach perfection, when all will ultimately be God. \"The loss and absence of Christ is the torment of the whole creation, nor do I think that there is any other.\" There is no \"place of punishment\" anywhere.',\n",
       " 'Evil is disintegration.[139] In its essence it is not merely unreal, but unreality as such. It can only appear in conjunction with some low degree of goodness which suggests to Plotinus the fine saying that \"vice at its worst is still human, being mixed with something opposite to itself.[140]\"',\n",
       " 'Faith, thus defined, is hardly distinguishable from that mixture of admiration, hope, and love by which Wordsworth says that we live. Love especially is intimately connected with faith. And as the Christian life is to be considered as, above all things, a state of union with Christ, and of His members with one another, love of the brethren is inseparable from love of God. So intimate is this union, that hatred towards any human being cannot exist in the same heart as love to God. The mystical union is indeed rather a bond between Christ and the Church, and between man and man as members of Christ, than between Christ and individual souls. Our Lord\\'s prayer is \"that they all may be one, even as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us.\" The personal relation between the soul and Christ is not to be denied; but it can only be enjoyed when the person has \"come to himself\" as a member of a body. This involves an inward transit from the false isolated self to the larger life of sympathy and love which alone makes us persons. Those who are thus living according to their true nature are rewarded with an intense unshakeable conviction which makes them independent of external evidences. Like the blind man who was healed, they can say, \"One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.\" The words \"we know\" are repeated again and again in the first Epistle, with an emphasis which leaves no room for doubt that the evangelist was willing to throw the main weight of his belief on this inner assurance, and to attribute it without hesitation to the promised presence of the Comforter. We must observe, however, that this knowledge or illumination is progressive. This is proved by the passages already quoted about the work of the Holy Spirit. It is also implied by the words, \"This is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.\" Eternal life is not [Greek: gnôsis], knowledge as a possession, but the state of acquiring knowledge ([Greek: hina gignôskôsin]). It is significant, I think, that St. John, who is so fond of the verb \"to know,\" never uses the substantive [Greek: gnôsis].',\n",
       " 'Finally, the spirit rises from the inner to the contemplative life. \"When we rise above ourselves, and in our ascent to God are made so simple that the love which embraces us is occupied only with itself, above the practice of all the virtues, then we are transformed and die in God to ourselves and to all separate individuality.\" God unites us with Himself in eternal love, which is Himself. \"In this embrace and essential unity with God all devout and inward spirits are one with God by living immersion and melting away into Him; they are by grace one and the same thing with Him, because the same essence is in both.\" \"For what we are, that we intently contemplate; and what we contemplate, that we are; for our mind, our life, and our essence are simply lifted up and united to the very truth, which is God. Wherefore in this simple and intent contemplation we are one life and one spirit with God. And this I call the contemplative life. In this highest stage the soul is united to God without means; it sinks into the vast darkness of the Godhead.\" In this abyss, he says, following his authorities, \"the Persons of the Trinity transcend themselves\"; \"there is only the eternal essence, which is the substance of the Divine Persons, where we are all one and uncreated, according to our prototypes.\" Here, \"so far as distinction of persons goes, there is no more God nor creature\"; \"we have lost ourselves and been melted away into the unknown darkness.\" And yet we remain eternally distinct from God. The creature remains a creature, and loses not its creatureliness. We must be conscious of ourselves in God, and conscious of ourselves in ourselves. For eternal life consists in the knowledge of God, and there can be no knowledge without self-consciousness. If we could be blessed without knowing it, a stone, which has no consciousness, might be blessed.',\n",
       " 'First, the soul (as well as the body) can see and perceive--[Greek: esti de psychês aisthêsis tis], as Proclus says. We have an organ or faculty for the discernment of spiritual truth, which, in its proper sphere, is as much to be trusted as the organs of sensation in theirs.',\n",
       " 'For Reason is still \"king.[33]\" Religion must not be a matter of feeling only. St. John\\'s command to \"try every spirit\" condemns all attempts to make emotion or inspiration independent of reason. Those who thus blindly follow the inner light find it no \"candle of the Lord,\" but an ignis fatuus; and the great mystics are well aware of this. The fact is that the tendency to separate and half personify the different faculties--intellect, will, feeling--is a mischievous one. Our object should be so to unify our personality, that our eye may be single, and our whole body full of light.',\n",
       " \"For us, he is most interesting as marking the transition from the purely subjective type of Mysticism to Symbolism, or rather as the author of a brilliant attempt to fuse the two into one system. In my brief sketch of Böhme's doctrines I shall illustrate his teaching from the later works of William Law, who is by far its best exponent. Law was an enthusiastic admirer of Böhme, and being, unlike his master, a man of learning and a practised writer, was able to bring order out of the chaos in which Böhme left his speculations. In strength of intellect Law was Böhme's equal, and as a writer of clear and forcible English he has few superiors.\",\n",
       " 'GOETHE, Iphigenie.',\n",
       " 'Gerson distinguishes symbolical, natural, and mystical theology, confining the last to the method which rests on inner experiences, and proceeds by the negative road. The experiences of the mystic have a greater certainty than any external revelations can possess.',\n",
       " 'God is above all that can be said of Him. We must not even call Him ineffable;[194] He is best adored in silence,[195] best known by nescience,[196] best described by negatives.[197] God is absolutely immutable; this is a doctrine on which he often insists, and which pervades all his teaching about predestination. The world pre-existed from all eternity in the mind of God; in the Word of God, by whom all things were made, and who is immutable Truth, all things and events are stored up together unchangeably, and all are one. God sees the time-process not as a process, but gathered up into one harmonious whole. This seems very near to acosmism, but there are other passages which are intended to guard against this error. For instance, in the Confessions[198] he says that \"things above are better than things below; but all creation together is better than things above\"; that is to say, true reality is something higher than an abstract spirituality.[199]',\n",
       " 'God is more than the All, as being the perfect Personality, whose Will is manifested in creation under necessarily imperfect conditions. He is also in a sense less than the All, since pain, weakness, and sin, though known to Him as infinite Mind, can hardly be felt by Him as infinite Perfection. The function of evil in the economy of the universe is an inscrutable mystery, about which speculative Mysticism merely asserts that the solution cannot be that of the Manicheans. It is only the Agnostic[185] who will here offer the dilemma of Dualism or Pantheism, and try to force the mystic to accept the second alternative.',\n",
       " 'God, according to Philo, is unqualified and pure Being, but not superessential. He is emphatically [Greek: ho ôn], the \"I am,\" and the most general ([Greek: to genikôtaton]) of existences. At the same time He is without qualities ([Greek: apoios]), and ineffable ([Greek: arrêtos]). In His inmost nature He is inaccessible; as it was said to Moses, \"Thou shalt see what is behind Me, but My face shall not be seen.\" It is best to contemplate God in silence, since we can compare Him to nothing that we know. All our knowledge of God is really God dwelling in us. He has breathed into us something of His nature, and is thus the archetype of what is highest in ourselves. He who is truly inspired \"may with good reason be called God.\" This blessed state may, however, be prepared for by such mediating agencies as the study of God\\'s laws in nature; and it is only the highest class of saints--the souls \"born of God\"--that are exalted above the need of symbols. It would be easy to show how Philo wavers between two conceptions of the Divine nature--God as simply transcendent, and God as immanent. But this is one of the things that make him most interesting. His Judaism will not allow him really to believe in a God \"without qualities.\"',\n",
       " 'God, says Erigena, is called Essence or Being; but, strictly speaking, He is not \"Being\";[214] for Being arises in opposition to not-Being, and there is no opposition to the Absolute, or God. Eternity, the abode or nature of God, is homogeneous and without parts, one, simple, and indivisible. \"God is the totality of all things which are and are not, which can and cannot be. He is the similarity of the similar, the dissimilarity of the dissimilar, the opposition of opposites, and the contrariety of contraries. All discords are resolved when they are considered as parts of the universal harmony.\" All things begin from unity and end in unity: the Absolute can contain nothing self-contradictory. And so God cannot be called Goodness, for Goodness is opposed to Badness, and God is above this distinction. Goodness, however is a more comprehensive term than Being. There may be Goodness without Being, but not Being without Goodness; for Evil is the negation of Being. \"The Scripture openly pronounces this,\" says Erigena; \"for we read, God saw all things; and not, lo, they were, but, lo, they were very good.\" All things are, in so far as they are good. \"But the things that are not are also called good, and are far better than those which are.\" Being, in fact, is a defect, \"since it separates from the superessential Good.\" The feeling which prompts this strange expression is that since time and space are themselves onesided appearances, a fixed limit must be set to the amount of goodness and reality which can be represented under these conditions. Erigena therefore thinks that to enter the time-process must be to contract a certain admixture of unreality or evil. In so far as life involves separateness (not distinction), this must be true; but the manifold is only evil when it is discordant and antagonistic to unity. That the many-in-one should appear as the one-in-many, is the effect of the forms of time and space in which it appears; the statement that \"the things which are not are far better than those which are,\" is only true in the sense that the world of appearance is permeated by evil as yet unsubdued, which in the Godhead exists only as something overcome or transmuted.',\n",
       " 'He is fond of speaking of the Beauty of God; and as he identifies beauty with symmetry,[200] it is plain that the formless \"Infinite\" is for him, as for every true Platonist, the bottom and not the top of the scale of being. Plotinus had perhaps been the first to speak of the Divine nature as the meeting-point of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful; and this conception, which is of great value, appears also in Augustine. There are three grades of beauty, they both say, corporeal, spiritual, and divine,[201] the first being an image of the second, and the second of the third.[202] \"Righteousness is the truest beauty,[203]\" Augustine says more than once. \"All that is beautiful comes from the highest Beauty, which is God.\" This is true Platonism, and points to Mysticism of the symbolic kind, which we must consider later. St. Augustine is on less secure ground when he says that evil is simply the splash of dark colour which gives relief to the picture; and when in other places he speaks of it as simple privation of good. But here again he closely follows Plotinus.[204]',\n",
       " 'He shows his affinity with the modern spirit in his firm grasp of natural law. Like George Fox and William Law, he had to face the shock of giving up his belief in arbitrary interferences. There was a period when he lost his young faculty of generalisation; when he bowed before the inexorable dooms of an unknown Lawgiver--\"the categorical imperative,\" till the gift of intuition was restored to him in fuller measure. This experience explains his attitude towards natural science. His reverence for facts never failed him; \"the sanctity and truth of nature,\" he says, \"must not be tricked out with accidental ornaments\"; but he looked askance at the science which tries to erect itself into a philosophy. Physics, he saw plainly, is an abstract study: its view of the world is an abstraction for certain purposes, and possesses less truth than the view of the poet.[371] And yet he looked forward to a time when science, too, shall be touched with fire from the altar;--',\n",
       " 'He then proceeds to deal with \"passive contemplation,\" and refers again to the \"unconscious prayer\" of St. Antony. But \"pure contemplation is never unintermittent in this life.\" \"Bernard, Teresa, and John say that their periods of pure contemplation lasted not more than half an hour.\" \"Pure contemplation,\" he proceeds, \"is negative, being occupied with no sensible image, no distinct and nameable idea; it stops only at the purely intellectual and abstract idea of being.\" Yet this idea includes, \"as distinct objects,\" all the attributes of God--\"as the Trinity, the humanity of Christ, and all His mysteries.\" \"To deny this is to annihilate Christianity under pretence of purifying it, and to confound God with néant. It is to form a kind of deism which at once falls into atheism, wherein all real idea of God as distinguished from His creatures is rejected.\" Lastly, it is to advance two impieties--(i.) To suppose that there is or may be on the earth a contemplative who is no longer a traveller, and who no longer needs the way, since he has reached his destination. (ii.) To ignore that Jesus Christ is the way as well as the truth and the life, the finisher as well as the author of our faith.',\n",
       " 'Henry Suso, whose autobiography is a document of unique importance for the psychology of Mysticism, was born in 1295[260]. Intellectually he is a disciple of Eckhart, whom he understands better than Ruysbroek; but his life and character are more like those of the Spanish mystics, especially St. Juan of the Cross. The text which is most often in his mouth is, \"Where I am, there shall also My servant be\"; which he interprets to mean that only those who have embraced to the full the fellowship of Christ\\'s sufferings, can hope to be united to Him in glory. \"No cross, no crown,\" is the law of life which Suso accepts in all the severity of its literal meaning. The story of the terrible penances which he inflicted on himself for part of his life is painful and almost repulsive to read; but they have nothing in common with the ostentatious self-torture of the fakir. Suso\\'s deeply affectionate and poetical temperament, with its strong human loves and sympathies, made the life of the cloister very difficult for him. He accepted it as the highest life, and strove to conform himself to its ideals; and when, after sixteen years of cruel austerities, he felt that his \"refractory body\" was finally tamed, he discontinued his mortifications, and entered upon a career of active usefulness. In this he had still heavier crosses to carry, for he was persecuted and falsely accused, while the spiritual consolations which had cheered him in his early struggles were often withdrawn. In his old age, shortly before his death in 1365, he published the history of his life, which is one of the most interesting and charming of all autobiographies. Suso\\'s literary gift is very remarkable. Unlike most ecstatic mystics, who declare on each occasion that \"tongue cannot utter\" their experiences, Suso\\'s store of glowing and vivid language never fails. The hunger and thirst of the soul for God, and the answering love of Christ manifested in the inner man, have never found a more pure and beautiful expression. In the hope of inducing more readers to become acquainted with this gem of mediæval literature, I will give a few extracts from its pages.',\n",
       " 'Her estimate of the value of means of grace is very clear and sound. \"In that time the custom of our praying was brought to mind, how we use, for lack of understanding and knowing of love, to make [use of] many means. Then saw I truly that it is more worship to God and more very delight that we faithfully pray to Himself of His goodness, and cleave thereto by His grace, with true understanding and steadfast by love, than if we made [use of] all the means that heart can think. For if we made [use of] all these means, it is too little, and not full worship to God; but in His goodness is all the whole, and there faileth right nought. For this, as I shall say, came into my mind. In the same time we pray to God for [the sake of] His holy flesh and precious blood, His holy passion, His dearworthy death and wounds: and all the blessed kinship, the endless life that we have of all this, is His goodness. And we pray Him for [the sake of] His sweet mother\\'s love, that Him bare; and all the help that we have of her is of His goodness.\" And yet \"God of His goodness hath advanced means to help us, full fair and many; of which the chief and principal mean is the blessed nature that He took of the maid, with all the means that go afore and come after which belong to our redemption and to endless salvation. Wherefore it pleaseth Him that we seek Him and worship Him through means, understanding and knowing that He is the goodness of all. For the goodness of God is the highest prayer, and it cometh down to the lowest part of our need. It quickeneth our soul, and bringeth it on life, and maketh it for to wax in grace and virtue. It is nearest in nature and readiest in grace; for it is the same grace that the soul seeketh, and ever shall seek till we know verily that He hath us all in Himself beclosed.\"',\n",

       " 'I believe that the Neoplatonic \"vision\" owes its place in the system to two very different causes. First, there was the direct influence of Oriental philosophy of the Indian type, which tries to reach the universal by wiping out all the boundary-lines of the particular, and to gain infinity by reducing self and the world to zero. Of this we shall say more when we come to Dionysius. And, secondly, the blank trance was a real psychical experience, quite different from the \"visions\" which we have already mentioned. Evidence is abundant; but I will content myself with one quotation.[148] In Amiel\\'s Journal[149] we have the following record of such a trance: \"Like a dream which trembles and dies at the first glimmer of dawn, all my past, all my present, dissolve in me, and fall away from my consciousness at the moment when it returns upon myself. I feel myself then stripped and empty, like a convalescent who remembers nothing. My travels, my reading, my studies, my projects, my hopes, have faded from my mind. All my faculties drop away from me like a cloak that one takes off, like the chrysalis case of a larva. I feel myself returning into a more elementary form.\" But Amiel, instead of expecting the advent of \"the One\" while in this state, feels that \"the pleasure of it is deadly, inferior in all respects to the joys of action, to the sweetness of love, to the beauty of enthusiasm, or to the sacred savour of accomplished duty.[149]\"',\n",
       " 'I conclude this Preface with a quotation from William Law on the value of the mystical writers. \"Writers like those I have mentioned,\" he says in a letter to Dr. Trapp, \"there have been in all ages of the Church, but as they served not the ends of popular learning, as they helped no people to figure or preferment in the world, and were useless to scholastic controversial writers, so they dropt out of public uses, and were only known, or rather unknown, under the name of mystical writers, till at last some people have hardly heard of that very name: though, if a man were to be told what is meant by a mystical divine, he must be told of something as heavenly, as great, as desirable, as if he was told what is meant by a real, regenerate, living member of the mystical body of Christ; for they were thus called for no other reason than as Moses and the prophets, and the saints of the Old Testament, may be called the spiritual Israel, or the true mystical Jews. These writers began their office of teaching as John the Baptist did, after they had passed through every kind of mortification and self-denial, every kind of trial and purification, both inward and outward. They were deeply learned in the mysteries of the kingdom of God, not through the use of lexicons, or meditating upon critics, but because they had passed from death unto life. They highly reverence and excellently direct the true use of everything that is outward in religion; but, like the Psalmist\\'s king\\'s daughter, they are all glorious within. They are truly sons of thunder, and sons of consolation; they break open the whited sepulchres; they awaken the heart, and show it its filth and rottenness of death: but they leave it not till the kingdom of heaven is raised up within it. If a man has no desire but to be of the spirit of the gospel, to obtain all that renovation of life and spirit which alone can make him to be in Christ a new creature, it is a great unhappiness to him to be unacquainted with these writers, or to pass a day without reading something of what they wrote.\"',\n",
       " 'I do not shrink from expressing my conviction that the true meaning of our sacramental system, which in its external forms is so strangely anticipated by the Greek mysteries, and in its inward significance strikes down to the fundamental principles of mystical Christianity, can only be understood by those who are in some sympathy with Mysticism. But it has not been possible to say much about the sacraments sooner than this late stage of our inquiry. We have hitherto been dealing with the subjective or introspective type of Mysticism, and it is plain that this form, when carried to its logical conclusion, is inconsistent with sacramental religion. Those who seek to ascend to God by the way of abstraction, the negative road, must regard all symbols as veils between our eyes and reality, and must wish to get rid of them as soon as possible. From this point of view, sacraments, like other ceremonial forms, can only be useful at a very early stage in the upward path, which leads us ultimately into a Divine darkness, where no forms can be distinguished. It is true that some devout mystics of this type have both observed and exacted a punctilious strictness in using all the appointed means of grace; but this inconsistency is easily accounted for.[330] The pressure of authority, loyalty to the established order, and human nature, which is stronger than either, has prevented them from casting away the time-honoured symbols and vehicles of Divine love. But a true appreciation of sacraments belongs only to those who can sympathise with the other branch of Mysticism--that which rests on belief in symbolism. To this branch of my subject I now invite your attention. If we expect to find ourselves at once in a larger air when we have taken leave of the monkish mystics, we shall be disappointed. The objective or symbolical type of Mysticism is liable to quite as many perversions as the subjective. If in the latter we found a tendency to revert to the apathy of the Indian Yogi, we shall observe in the former too many survivals of still more barbarous creeds. Indeed, I feel that it is almost necessary, as an introduction to this part of my subject, to consider very briefly the stages through which the religious consciousness of mankind has passed in its attempts to realise Divine immanence in Nature, for this is, of course, the foundation of all religious symbolism.',\n",
       " 'I have criticised this definition in my first Lecture, and have suggested that the words \"rationalism\" and \"reason\" ought to be transposed. Elsewhere Harnack says that the distinctions between \"Scholastic, Roman, German, Catholic, Evangelical, and Pantheistic Mysticism\" are at best superficial, and in particular that it is a mistake to contrast \"Scholasticism and Mysticism\" as opposing forces in the Middle Ages. \"Mysticism,\" he proceeds, \"is Catholic piety in general, so far as this piety is not merely ecclesiastical obedience, that is, fides implicita. The Reformation element which is ascribed to it lies simply in this, that Mysticism, when developed in a particular direction, is led to discern the inherent responsibility of the soul, of which no authority can again deprive it.\" The conflicts between Mysticism and Church authority, he thinks, in no way militate against both being Catholic ideals, just as asceticism and world-supremacy are both Catholic ideals, though contradictory. The German mystics he disparages. \"I give no extracts from their writings,\" he says, \"because I do not wish even to seem to countenance the error that they expressed anything that one cannot read in Origen, Plotinus, the Areopagite, Augustine, Erigena, Bernard, and Thomas, or that they represented religious progress.\" \"It will never be possible to make Mysticism Protestant without flying in the face of history and Catholicism.\" \"A mystic who does not become a Catholic is a dilettante.\"',\n",
       " 'I have decided to end my survey of Christian Mysticism with these two English poets. It would hardly be appropriate, in this place, to discuss Carlyle\\'s doctrine of symbols, as the \"clothing\" of religious and other kinds of truth. His philosophy is wanting in some of the essential features of Mysticism, and can hardly be called Christian without stretching the word too far. And Emerson, when he deals with religion, is a very unsafe guide. The great American mystic, whose beautiful character was as noble a gift to humanity as his writings, is more liable than any of those whom we have described to the reproach of having turned his back on the dark side of life. Partly from a fastidiousness which could not bear even to hear of bodily ailments, partly from the natural optimism of the dweller in a new country, and partly because he made a principle of maintaining an unruffled cheerfulness and serenity, he shut his eyes to pain, death, and sin, even more resolutely than did Goethe. The optimism which is built on this foundation has no message of comfort for the stricken heart. To say that \"evil is only good in the making,\" is to repeat an ancient and discredited attempt to solve the great enigma. And to assert that perfect justice is meted out to individuals in this world, is surely mere dreaming. Moreover, we can hardly acquit him of playing with pantheistic Mysticism of the Oriental type, without seeing, or without caring, whither such speculations logically lead. \"Within man,\" he tells us, \"is the soul of the whole, the wise silence, the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related--the eternal One.\" This is genuine Pantheism, and should carry with it the doctrine that all actions are equally good, bad, or indifferent. Emerson says that his wife kept him from antinomianism; but this is giving up the defence of his philosophy. He also differs from Christianity, and agrees with many Hegelians, in teaching that God, \"the Over-Soul,\" only attains to self-consciousness in man; and this, combined with his denial of degrees in Divine immanence, leads him to a self-deification of an arrogant and shocking kind, such as we find in the Persian Sufis, and in some heretical mystics of the Middle Ages. \"I, the imperfect, adore my own Perfect. I am receptive of the great soul. I become a transparent eyeball. I am nothing. I see all. The currents of the universal Being circulate through me. I am part of God\"; and much more to the same effect. This is not the language of those who have travelled up the mystical ladder, instead of only writing about it. It is far more objectionable than the bold phrases about deification which I quoted in my fifth Lecture from the fourteenth century mystics; because with them the passage into the Divine glory is the final reward, only to be attained \"by all manner of exercises\"; while for Emerson it seems to be a state already existing, which we can realise by a mere act of intellectual apprehension. And the phrase, \"Man is a part of God,\"--as if the Divine Spirit were divided among the organs which express its various activities,--has been condemned by all the great speculative mystics, from Plotinus downwards. Emerson is perhaps at his best when he applies his idealism to love and friendship. The spiritualising and illuminating influence of pure comradeship has never been better or more religiously set forth. And though it is necessary to be on our guard against the very dangerous tendency of some of his teaching, we shall find much to learn from the brave and serene philosopher whose first maxim was, \"Come out into the azure; love the day,\" and who during his whole life fixed his thoughts steadily on whatsoever things are pure, lovely, noble, and of good report.',\n",
       " \"I have received much help from many kind friends; and though some of them would not wish to be associated with all of my opinions, I cannot deny myself the pleasure of thanking them by name. From my mother and other members of my family, and relations, especially Mr. W.W. How, Fellow of Merton, I have received many useful suggestions. Three past or present colleagues have read and criticised parts of my work--the Rev. H. Rashdall, now Fellow of New College; Mr. H.A. Prichard, now Fellow of Trinity; and Mr. H.H. Williams, Fellow of Hertford. Mr. G.L. Dickinson, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, lent me an unpublished dissertation on Plotinus. The Rev. C. Bigg, D.D., whose Bampton Lectures on the Christian Platonists are known all over Europe, did me the kindness to read the whole of the eight Lectures, and so added to the great debt which I owe to him for his books. The Rev. J.M. Heald, formerly Scholar of Trinity, Cambridge, lent me many books from his fine library, and by inquiring for me at Louvain enabled me to procure the books on Mysticism which are now studied in Roman Catholic Universities. The Rev. Dr. Lindsay, who has made a special study of the German mystics, read my Lectures on that period, and wrote me a very useful letter upon them. Miss G.H. Warrack of Edinburgh kindly allowed me to use her modernised version of Julian of Norwich.\",\n",
       " 'I have spoken with a plainness which will probably give offence of the debased supernaturalism which usurps the name of Mysticism in Roman Catholic countries. I desire to insult no man\\'s convictions; and it is for this reason that I have decided not to print my analysis of Ribet\\'s work (La Mystique Divine, distinguée des Contrefaçons diaboliques. Nouvelle Edition, Paris, 1895, 3 vols.), which I intended to form an Appendix. It would have opened the eyes of some of my readers to the irreconcilable antagonism between the Roman Church and science; but though I translated and summarised my author faithfully, the result had all the appearance of a malicious travesty. I have therefore suppressed this Appendix; but with regard to Roman Catholic \"Mysticism\" there is no use in mincing matters. Those who find edification in signs and wonders of this kind, and think that such \"supernatural phenomena,\" even if they were well authenticated instead of being ridiculous fables, could possibly establish spiritual truths, will find little or nothing to please or interest them in these pages. But those who reverence Nature and Reason, and have no wish to hear of either of them being \"overruled\" or \"suspended,\" will, I hope, agree with me in valuing highly the later developments of mystical thought in Northern Europe.',\n",
       " 'I have ventured to say in my last Lecture--and it is my earnest conviction--that a more general acquaintance with mystical theology and philosophy is very desirable in the interests of the English Church at the present time. I am not one of those who think that the points at issue between Anglo-Catholics and Anglo-Protestants are trivial: history has always confirmed Aristotle\\'s famous dictum about parties--[Greek: gignontai ai staseis ou peri mikrôn all\\' ek mikrôn, stasiazousi de peri megalôn]--but I do not so far despair of our Church, or of Christianity, as to doubt that a reconciling principle must and will be found. Those who do me the honour to read these Lectures will see to what quarter I look for a mediator. A very short study would be sufficient to dispel some of the prejudices which still hang round the name of Mysticism--e.g., that its professors are unpractical dreamers, and that this type of religion is antagonistic to the English mind. As a matter of fact, all the great mystics have been energetic and influential, and their business capacity is specially noted in a curiously large number of cases. For instance, Plotinus was often in request as a guardian and trustee; St. Bernard showed great gifts as an organiser; St. Teresa, as a founder of convents and administrator, gave evidence of extraordinary practical ability; even St. Juan of the Cross displayed the same qualities; John Smith was an excellent bursar of his college; Fénelon ruled his diocese extremely well; and Madame Guyon surprised those who had dealings with her by her great aptitude for affairs. Henry More was offered posts of high responsibility and dignity, but declined them. The mystic is not as a rule ambitious, but I do not think he often shows incapacity for practical life, if he consents to mingle in it. And so far is it from being true that Great Britain has produced but few mystics, that I am inclined to think the subject might be adequately studied from English writers alone. On the more intellectual side we have (without going back to Scotus Erigena) the Cambridge Platonists, Law and Coleridge; of devotional mystics we have attractive examples in Hilton and Julian of Norwich; while in verse the lofty idealism[1] and strong religious bent of our race have produced a series of poet-mystics such as no other country can rival. It has not been possible in these Lectures to do justice to George Herbert, Vaughan \"the Silurist,\" Quarles, Crashaw, and others, who have all drunk of the same well. Let it suffice to say that the student who desires to master the history of Mysticism in Britain will find plenty to occupy his time. But for the religious public in general the most useful thing would be a judicious selection from the mystical writers of different times and countries. Those who are more interested in the practical and devotional than the speculative side may study with great profit some parts of St. Augustine, the sermons of Tauler, the Theologia Germanica, Hilton\\'s Scale of Perfection, the Life of Henry Suso, St. Francis de Sales and Fénelon, the Sermons of John Smith and Whichcote\\'s Aphorisms, and the later works of William Law, not forgetting the poets who have been mentioned. I can think of no course of study more fitting for those who wish to revive in themselves and others the practical idealism of the primitive Church, which gained for it its greatest triumphs.',\n",
       " 'If it be further asked, Which is our personality, the shifting moi (as Fénelon calls it), or the ideal self, the end or the developing states? we must answer that it is both and neither, and that the root of mystical religion is in the conviction that it is at once both and neither.[52] The moi strives to realise its end, but the end being an infinite one, no process can reach it. Those who have \"counted themselves to have apprehended\" have thereby left the mystical faith; and those who from the notion of a progressus ad infinitum come to the pessimistic conclusion, are equally false to the mystical creed, which teaches us that we are already potentially what God intends us to become. The command, \"Be ye perfect,\" is, like all Divine commands, at the same time a promise.',\n",
       " 'In Jewish writings of a later period, composed under Greek influence, we find plenty of Platonism ready to pass into Mysticism. But the Wisdom of Solomon does not fall within our subject, and what is necessary to be said about Philo and Alexandria will be said in the next Lecture. In the New Testament, it will be convenient to say a very few words on the Synoptic Gospels first, and afterwards to consider St. John and St. Paul, where we shall find most of our material.',\n",
       " 'In St. John, as in mystical theology generally, the Incarnation, rather than the Cross, is the central fact of Christianity. \"The Word was made flesh, and tabernacled among us,\" is for him the supreme dogma. And it follows necessarily from the Logos doctrine, that the Incarnation, and all that followed it, is regarded primarily as a revelation of life and light and truth. \"That eternal life, which was with the Father, has been manifested unto us,\" is part of the opening sentence of the first Epistle.[62] \"This is the message which we have heard of Him and announce unto you, that God is Light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\" In coming into the world, Christ \"came unto His own.\" He had, in a sense, only to show to them what was there already: Esaias, long before, had \"seen His glory, and spoken of Him.\" The mysterious estrangement, which had laid the world under the dominion of the Prince of darkness, had obscured but not quenched the light which lighteth every man--the inalienable prerogative of all who derive their being from the Sun of Righteousness. This central Light is Christ, and Christ only. He alone is the Way, the Truth, the Life, the Door, the Living Bread, and the True Vine. He is at once the Revealer and the Revealed, the Guide and the Way, the Enlightener and the Light. No man cometh unto the Father but by Him.',\n",
       " 'In aloofness and loneliness of mind he is exceeded by no mystic of the cloister. It may be said far more truly of him than of Milton, that \"his soul was like a star, and dwelt apart.\" In his youth he confesses that human beings had only a secondary interest for him;[372] and though he says that Nature soon led him to man, it was to man as a \"unity,\" as \"one spirit,\" that he was drawn, not to men as individuals.[373] Herein he resembled many other contemplative mystics; but it has been said truly that \"it is easier to know man in general than a man in particular.[374]\" The sage who \"sits in the centre\" of his being, and there \"enjoys bright day,[375]\" does not really know human beings as persons.',\n",
       " 'In another vision he saw \"the blessed master Eckhart,\" who had lately died in disfavour with the rulers of the Church. \"He signified to the servitor that he was in exceeding glory, and that his soul was quite transformed, and made Godlike in God.\" In answer to questions, \"the blessed Master\" told him that \"words cannot tell the manner in which those persons dwell in God who have really detached themselves from the world, and that the way to attain this detachment is to die to self, and to maintain unruffled patience with all men.\"',\n",
       " 'In comparing the Mysticism of Eckhart with that of his predecessors, from Dionysius downwards, and of the scholastics down to Gerson, we find an obvious change in the disappearance of the long ladders of ascent, the graduated scales of virtues, faculties, and states of mind, which fill so large a place in those systems. These lists are the natural product of the imagination, when it plays upon the theory of emanation. But with Eckhart, as we have seen, the fundamental truth is the immanence of God Himself, not in the faculties, but in the ground of the soul. The \"spark of the soul\" is for him really \"divinæ particula auræ.\" \"God begets His Son in me,\" he is fond of saying: and there is no doubt that, relying on a verse in the seventeenth chapter of St. John, he regards this \"begetting\" as analogous to the eternal generation of the Son.[255] This birth of the Son in the soul has a double aspect--the \"eternal birth,\" which is unconscious and inalienable,[256] but which does not confer blessedness, being common to good and bad alike; and the assimilation of the faculties of the soul by the pervading presence of Christ, or in other words by grace, \"quæ lux quædam deiformis est,\" as Ruysbroek says. The deification of our nature is therefore a thing to be striven for, and not given complete to start with; but it is important to observe that Eckhart places no intermediaries between man and God. \"The Word is very nigh thee,\" nearer than any object of sense, and any human institutions; sink into thyself, and thou wilt find Him. The heavenly and earthly hierarchies of Dionysius, with the reverence for the priesthood which was built upon them, have no significance for Eckhart. In this as in other ways, he is a precursor of the Reformation.',\n",
       " 'In his doctrine of God we find that he has fallen a victim to the unfortunate negative method, which he calls \"analysis.\" It is the method which starts with the assertion that since God is exalted above Being, we cannot say what He is, but only what He is not. Clement apparently objects to saying that God is above Being, but he strips Him of all attributes and qualities till nothing is left but a nameless point; and this, too, he would eliminate, for a point is a numerical unit, and God is above the idea of the Monad. We shall encounter this argument far too often in our survey of Mysticism, and in writers more logical than Clement, who allowed it to dominate their whole theology and ethics.',\n",
       " 'In his letter to the Pope, which accompanies the \"Explanation of the Maxims,\" Fénelon thus sums up his distinctions between true and false Mysticism:--',\n",
       " 'In his teaching about faith and love, Law follows the best mystical writers; but none before him, I think, attained to such strong and growing eloquence in setting it forth. \"There is but one salvation for all mankind, and the way to it is one; and that is, the desire of the soul turned to God. This desire brings the soul to God, and God into the soul; it unites with God, it co-operates with God, and is one life with God. O my God, just and true, how great is Thy love and mercy to mankind, that heaven is thus everywhere open, and Christ thus the common Saviour to all that turn the desire of their hearts to Thee!\" And of love he says: \"No creature can have any union or communion with the goodness of the Deity till its life is a spirit of love. This is the one only bond of union betwixt God and His creature.\" \"Love has no by-ends, wills nothing but its own increase: everything is as oil to its flame. The spirit of love does not want to be rewarded, honoured, or esteemed; its only desire is to propagate itself, and become the blessing and happiness of everything that wants it.\"',\n",
       " 'In one of her visions she was shown our Lord \"scorning the fiend\\'s malice, and noughting his unmight.\" \"For this sight I laught mightily, and that made them to laugh that were about me. But I saw not Christ laugh. After this I fell into graveness, and said, \\'I see three things: I see game, scorn, and earnest. I see game, that the fiend is overcome; I see scorn, in that God scorneth him, and he shall be scorned; and I see earnest, in that he is overcome by the blissful passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, that was done in full earnest and with sober travail.\\'\"',\n",
       " 'In reply to this manifesto, the \"Three Prelates[311]\" rejoin that Fénelon keeps the name of hope but takes away the thing; that he really preaches indifference to salvation; that he is in danger of regarding contemplation of Christ as a descent from the heights of pure contemplation; that he unaccountably says nothing of the \"love of gratitude\" to God and our Redeemer; that he \"erects the rare and transient experiences of a few saints into a rule of faith.\"',\n",
       " 'In speaking of the highest of the three stages, passages were quoted which advocate a purely passive state of the will and intellect.[273] This quietistic tendency cannot be denied in the fourteenth century mystics, though it is largely counteracted by maxims of an opposite kind. \"God draws us,\" says Tauler, \"in three ways, first, by His creatures; secondly, by His voice in the soul, when an eternal truth mysteriously suggests itself, as happens not infrequently in morning sleep.\" (This is interesting, being evidently the record of personal experience.) \"Thirdly, without resistance or means, when the will is quite subdued.\" \"What is given through means is tasteless; it is seen through a veil, and split up into fragments, and bears with it a certain sting of bitterness.\" There are other passages in which he is obviously under the influence of Dionysius; as when he speaks of \"dying to all distinctions\"; in fact, he at times preaches \"simplification\" in an unqualified form. But, on the other hand, no Christian teachers have made more of the active will than these pupils of Eckhart.[274] \"Ye are as holy as ye truly will to be holy,\" says Ruysbroek. \"With the will one may do everything,\" we read in Tauler. And against the perversion of the \"negative road\" he says, \"we must lop and prune vices, not nature, which is in itself good and noble.\" And \"Christ Himself never arrived at the \\'emptiness\\' of which these men (the false mystics) talk.\" Of contemplation he says, \"Spiritual enjoyments are the food of the soul, and are only to be taken for nourishment and support to help us in our active work.\" \"Sloth often makes men fain to be excused from their work and set to contemplation. Never trust in a virtue that has not been put into practice.\" These pupils of Eckhart all led strenuous lives themselves, and were no advocates of pious indolence. Tauler says, \"Works of love are more acceptable to God than lofty contemplation\": and, \"All kinds of skill are gifts of the Holy Ghost.[275]\"',\n",
       " \"In spite of St. Augustine's Platonism and the immense influence which he exercised, the Western Church was slow in developing a mystical theology. The Greek Mysticism, based on emanation, was not congenial to the Western mind, and the time of the German, with its philosophy of immanence, was not yet. The tendency of Eastern thinkers is to try to gain a view of reality as a whole, complete and entire: the form under which it most readily pictures it is that of space. The West seeks rather to discover the universal laws which in every part of the universe are working out their fulfilment. The form under which it most readily pictures reality is that of time.[210] Thus Neoplatonism had to undergo certain modifications before it could enter deeply into the religious consciousness of the West.\",\n",
       " 'In the \"third night\"--that of memory and will--the soul sinks into a holy inertia and oblivion (santa ociosidad y olvido), in which the flight of time is unfelt, and the mind is unconscious of all particular thoughts. St. Juan seems here to have brought us to something like the torpor of the Indian Yogi or of the hesychasts of Mount Athos. But he does not intend us to regard this state of trance as permanent or final. It is the last watch of the night before the dawn of the supernatural state, in which the human faculties are turned into Divine attributes, and by a complete transformation the soul, which was \"at the opposite extreme\" to God, \"becomes, by participation, God.\" In this beatific state \"one might say, in a sense, that the soul gives God to God, for she gives to God all that she receives of God; and He gives Himself to her. This is the mystical love-gift, wherewith the soul repayeth all her debt.\" This is the infinite reward of the soul who has refused to be content with anything short of infinity (no se llenan menos que con lo Infinito). With what yearning this blessed hope inspired St. Juan, is shown in the following beautiful prayer, which is a good example of the eloquence, born of intense emotion, which we find here and there in his pages: \"O sweetest love of God, too little known; he who has found Thee is at rest; let everything be changed, O God, that we may rest in Thee. Everywhere with Thee, O my God, everywhere all things with Thee; as I wish, O my Love, all for Thee, nothing for me--nothing for me, everything for Thee. All sweetness and delight for Thee, none for me--all bitterness and trouble for me, none for Thee. O my God, how sweet to me Thy presence, who art the supreme Good! I will draw near to Thee in silence, and will uncover Thy feet,[300] that it may please Thee to unite me to Thyself, making my soul Thy bride; I will rejoice in nothing till I am in Thine arms. O Lord, I beseech Thee, leave me not for a moment, because I know not the value of mine own soul.\"',\n",
       " 'In the Apocalypse, whoever the author may be, we find little or nothing of the characteristic Johannine Mysticism, and the influence of its vivid allegorical pictures has been less potent in this branch of theology than might perhaps have been expected.',\n",
       " 'In the Greek Fathers we find great stress laid on the glories of Nature as a revelation of God. Cyril says, \"The wider our contemplation of creation, the grander will be our conception of God.\" And Basil uses the same language. We find, indeed, in these writers a marked tendency to exalt the religious value of natural beauty, and to disparage the function of art--a premonition, perhaps, of iconoclasm. Pagan art, which was decaying before the advent of Christ, could not, it appears, be quietly Christianised and carried on without a break.',\n",
       " 'In the first stage of the \"dying life,\" he says elsewhere, we are much oppressed by the sense of our infirmities, and by the fear of hell. But in the third, \"all our griefs and joys are a sympathy with Christ, whose earthly life was a mingled web of grief and joy, and this life He has left as a sacred testament to His followers.\"',\n",
       " 'In the night of sense, the understanding and reason are not blind; but in the second night, the night of faith, \"all is darkness.\" \"Faith is midnight\"; it is the deepest darkness that we have to pass; for in the \"third night, the night of memory and will,\" the dawn is at hand. \"Faith\" he defines as \"the assent of the soul to what we have heard\"--as a blind man would receive a statement about the colour of an object. We must be totally blind, \"for a partially blind man will not commit himself wholly to his guide.\" Thus for St. Juan the whole content of revelation is removed from the scope of the reason, and is treated as something communicated from outside. We have, indeed, travelled far from St. Clement\\'s happy confidence in the guidance of reason, and Eckhart\\'s independence of tradition. The soul has three faculties--intellect, memory, and will. The imagination (fantasia) is a link between the sensitive and reasoning powers, and comes between the intellect and memory.[298] Of these faculties, \"faith (he says) blinds the intellect, hope the memory, and love the will.\" He adds, \"to all that is not God\"; but \"God in this life is like night.\" He blames those who think it enough to deny themselves \"without annihilating themselves,\" and those who \"seek for satisfaction in God.\" This last is \"spiritual gluttony.\" \"We ought to seek for bitterness rather than sweetness in God,\" and \"to choose what is most disagreeable, whether proceeding from God or the world.\" \"The way of God consisteth not in ways of devotion or sweetness, though these may be necessary to beginners, but in giving ourselves up to suffer.\" And so we must fly from all \"mystical phenomena\" (supernatural manifestations to the sight, hearing, and the other senses) \"without examining whether they be good or evil.\" \"For bodily sensations bear no proportion to spiritual things\"; since the distance \"between God and the creature is infinite,\" \"there is no essential likeness or communion between them.\" Visions are at best \"childish toys\"; \"the fly that touches honey cannot fly,\" he says; and the probability is that they come from the devil. For \"neither the creatures, nor intellectual perceptions, natural or supernatural, can bring us to God, there being no proportion between them. Created things cannot serve as a ladder; they are only a hindrance and a snare.\"',\n",
       " 'In theory, it may not be easy to reconcile \"earnest striving\" with complete surrender and abrogation of the will, but the logic of the heart does not find them incompatible. Perhaps no one has spoken better on this matter than the Rabbi Gamaliel, of whom it is reported that he prayed, \"O Lord, grant that I may do Thy will as if it were my will, that Thou mayest do my will as if it were Thy will.\" But quietistic Mysticism often puts the matter on a wrong basis. Self-will is to be annihilated, not (as St. Teresa sometimes implies) because our thoughts are so utterly different from God\\'s thoughts that they cannot exist in the same mind, but because self-interest sets up an unnatural antagonism between them. The will, like the other faculties, only realises itself in its fulness when God worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.',\n",
       " 'In these scholastic and modern Roman Catholic definitions we may observe (a) that the earlier definitions supplement without contradicting each other, representing different aspects of Mysticism, as an experimental science, as a living sacrifice of the will, as an illumination from above, and as an exercise of ardent devotion; (b) that symbolic or objective Mysticism is not recognised; (c) that the sharp distinction between natural and supernatural, which is set up by the scholastic mystics, carries with it a craving for physical \"mystical phenomena\" to support the belief in supernatural interventions. These miracles, though not mentioned in the earlier definitions, have come to be considered an integral part of Mysticism, so that Migne and Ribet include them in their definitions; (d) lastly, that those who take this view of \"la mystique divine\" are constrained to admit by the side of true mystical facts a parallel class of \"contrefaçons diaboliques.\"',\n",
       " 'In this Lecture we are following the line of speculative Mysticism, and we have now to consider the greatest of all speculative mystics, Meister Eckhart, who was born soon after the middle of the thirteenth century.[234] He was a Dominican monk, prior of Erfurt and vicar of Thuringen, and afterwards vicar-general for Bohemia. He preached a great deal at Cologne about 1325; and before this period had come into close relations with the Beghards and Brethren of the Free Spirit--societies of men and women who, by their implicit faith in the inner light, resembled the Quakers, though many of them, as has been said, were accused of immoral theories and practices. His teaching soon attracted the attention of the Inquisition, and some of his doctrines were formally condemned by the Pope in 1329, immediately after his death.',\n",
       " 'In this controversy about disinterested love, our sympathies are chiefly, but not entirely, with Fénelon. The standpoint of Bossuet is not religious at all. \"Pure love,\" he says almost coarsely, \"is opposed to the essence of love, which always desires the enjoyment of its object, as well as to the nature of man, who necessarily desires happiness.\" Most of us will rather agree with St. Bernard, that love, as such, desires nothing but reciprocation--\"verus amor se ipso contentus est: habet præmium, sed id quod amatur.\" If the question had been simply whether religion is or is not in its nature mercenary, we should have felt no doubt on which side the truth lay. Self-regarding hopes and schemes may be schoolmasters to bring us to Christ; it seems, indeed, to be part of our education to form them, and then see them shattered one after another, that better and deeper hopes may be constructed out of the fragments; but a selfish Christianity is a contradiction in terms. But Fénelon, in his teaching about disinterested love, goes further than this. \"A man\\'s self,\" he says, \"is his own greatest cross.\" \"We must therefore become strangers to this self, this moi.\" Resignation is not a remedy; for \"resignation suffers in suffering; one is as two persons in resignation; it is only pure love that loves to suffer.\" This is the thought with which many of us are familiar in James Hinton\\'s Mystery of Pain. It is at bottom Stoical or Buddhistic, in spite of the emotional turn given to it by Fénelon. Logically, it should lead to the destruction of love; for love requires two living factors,[312] and the person who has attained a \"holy indifference,\" who has passed wholly out of self, is as incapable of love as of any other emotion. The attempt \"to wind ourselves too high for mortal man\" has resulted, as usual, in two opposite errors. We find, on the one hand, some who try to escape the daily sacrifices which life demands, by declaring themselves bankrupt to start with. And, on the other hand, we find men like Fénelon, who are too good Christians to wish to shift their crosses in this way; but who allow their doctrines of \"holy indifference\" and \"pure love\" to impart an excessive sternness to their teaching, and demand from us an impossible degree of detachment and renunciation.',\n",
       " \"In treating of St. John, it was necessary to protest against the tendency of some commentators to interpret him simply as a speculative mystic of the Alexandrian type. But when we turn to St. Paul, we find reason to think that this side of his theology has been very much underestimated, and that the distinctive features of Mysticism are even more marked in him than in St. John. This is not surprising, for our blessed Lord's discourses, in which nearly all the doctrinal teaching of St. John is contained, are for all Christians; they rise above the oppositions which must always divide human thought and human thinkers. In St. Paul, large-minded as he was, and inspired as we believe him to be, we may be allowed to see an example of that particular type which we are considering.\",\n",
       " 'It hardly falls within my task to attempt to determine what these visions really are. The subject is one upon which psychological and medical science may some day throw more light. But this much I must say, to make my own position clear: I regard these experiences as neither more nor less \"supernatural\" than other mental phenomena. Many of them are certainly pathological;[28] about others we may feel doubts; but some have every right to be considered as real irradiations of the soul from the light that \"for ever shines,\" real notes of the harmony that \"is in immortal souls.\" In illustration of this, we may appeal to three places in the Bible where revelations of the profoundest truths concerning the nature and counsels of God are recorded to have been made during ecstatic visions. Moses at Mount Horeb heard, during the vision of the burning bush, a proclamation of God as the \"I am\"--the Eternal who is exalted above time. Isaiah, in the words \"Holy, Holy, Holy,\" perceived dimly the mystery of the Trinity. And St. Peter, in the vision of the sheet, learned that God is no respecter of persons or of nationalities. In such cases the highest intuitions or revelations, which the soul can in its best moments just receive, but cannot yet grasp or account for, make a language for themselves, as it were, and claim the sanction of external authority, until the mind is elevated so far as to feel the authority not less Divine, but no longer external. We may find fairly close analogies in other forms of that \"Divine madness,\" which Plato says is \"the source of the chiefest blessings granted to men\"--such as the rapture of the poet, or (as Plato adds) of the lover.[29] And even the philosopher or man of science may be surprised into some such state by a sudden realisation of the sublimity of his subject. So at least Lacordaire believed when he wrote, \"All at once, as if by chance, the hair stands up, the breath is caught, the skin contracts, and a cold sword pierces to the very soul. It is the sublime which has manifested itself![30]\" Even in cases where there is evident hallucination, e.g. when the visionary sees an angel or devil sitting on his book, or feels an arrow thrust into his heart, there need be no insanity. In periods when it is commonly believed that such things may and do happen, the imagination, instead of being corrected by experience, is misled by it. Those who honestly expect to see miracles will generally see them, without detriment either to their truthfulness or sanity in other matters.',\n",
       " 'It has been said of Wordsworth, as it has been said of other mystics, that he averts his eyes \"from half of human fate.\" Religious writers have explained that the neglected half is that which lies beneath the shadow of the Cross. The existence of positive evil in the world, as a great fact, and the consequent need of redemption, is, in the opinion of many, too little recognised by Wordsworth, and by Mysticism in general. This objection has been urged both from the scientific and from the religious side. It is held by many students of Nature that her laws affirm a Pessimism and not an Optimism. \"Red in tooth and claw with ravine,\" she shrieks against the creed that her Maker is a God of love. The only morality which she inculcates is that of a tiger in the jungle, or at best that of a wolf-pack. \"It is not strange (says Lotze) that no nature-religions have raised their adherents to any high pitch of morality or culture.[390]\" The answer to this is that Nature includes man as well as the brutes, and the merciful and moral man as well as the savage. Physical science, at any rate, can exclude nothing from the domain of Nature. And the Christian may say with all reverence that Nature includes, or rather is included by, Christ, the Word of God, by whom it was made. And the Word was made flesh to teach us that vicarious suffering, which we see to be the law of Nature, is a law of God, a thing not foreign to His own life, and therefore for all alike a condition of perfection, not a reductio ad absurdum of existence. The reductio ad absurdum is not of Nature, but of selfish individualism, which suffers shipwreck alike in objective and in subjective religion. It is precisely because the shadow of the Cross lies across the world, that we can watch Nature at work with \"admiration, hope, and love,\" instead of with horror and disgust.',\n",
       " 'It has been said that \"Mysticism is the philosophy of Spain.[284]\" This does not mean that idealistic philosophy flourished in the Peninsula, for the Spanish race has never shown any taste for metaphysics. The Mysticism of Spain is psychological; its point of departure is not the notion of Being or of Unity, but the human soul seeking reconcilation with God. We need not be on our guard against pantheism in reading the Spanish mystics; they show no tendency to obliterate the dividing lines of personality, or to deify sinful humanity. The cause of this peculiarity is to be sought partly in the strong individualism of the Spanish character, and partly in external circumstances.[285] Free thought in Spain was so sternly repressed, that those tendencies of mystical religion which are antagonistic to Catholic discipline were never allowed to display themselves. The Spanish mystics remained orthodox Romanists, subservient to their \"directors\" and \"superiors,\" and indefatigable in making recruits for the cloister. Even so, they did not escape the attention of the Inquisition; and though two among them, St. Teresa and St. Juan of the Cross, were awarded the badge of sanctity, the fate of Molinos showed how Rome had come to dread even the most submissive mystics.',\n",
       " 'It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure; but our own nature and personality remain intact. It is plain that we could not see God unless our personality remained distinct from the personality of God. Complete fusion is as destructive of the possibility of love and knowledge as complete separation[249].',\n",
       " 'It is difficult to abstain from quoting more passages like this, in which Faith, which had been so long directed only to the unseen and unknown, sheds her bright beams over this earth of ours, and claims all nature for her own. The laws of nature are now recognised as the laws of God, and for that very reason they cannot be broken or arbitrarily suspended. Redemption is a law of life. There will come a time[356], \"the time of the lilies,\" as Böhme calls it, when all nature will be delivered from bondage. \"All the design of Christian redemption,\" says Law, \"is to remove everything that is unheavenly, gross, dark, wrathful, and disordered from every part of this fallen world.\" No text is oftener in his mouth than the words of St. Paul which I read as the text of this Lecture. That \"dim sympathy\" of the human spirit with the life of nature which Plotinus felt, but which mediæval dualism had almost quenched, has now become an intense and happy consciousness of community with all living things, as subjects of one all-embracing and unchanging law, the law of perfect love. Magic and portents, apparitions and visions, the raptures of \"infused contemplation\" and their dark Nemesis of Satanic delusions, can no more trouble the serenity of him who has learnt to see the same God in nature whom he has found in the holy place of his own heart.',\n",
       " 'It is not claimed that Mysticism, even in its widest sense, is, or can ever be, the whole of Christianity. Every religion must have an institutional as well as a mystical element. Just as, if the feeling of immediate communion with God has faded, we shall have a dead Church worshipping \"a dead Christ,\" as Fox the Quaker said of the Anglican Church in his day; so, if the seer and prophet expel the priest, there will be no discipline and no cohesion. Still, at the present time, the greatest need seems to be that we should return to the fundamentals of spiritual religion. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that both the old seats of authority, the infallible Church and the infallible book, are fiercely assailed, and that our faith needs reinforcements. These can only come from the depths of the religious consciousness itself; and if summoned from thence, they will not be found wanting. The \"impregnable rock\" is neither an institution nor a book, but a life or experience. Faith, which is an affirmation of the basal personality, is its own evidence and justification. Under normal conditions, it will always be strongest in the healthiest minds. There is and can be no appeal from it. If, then, our hearts, duly prepared for the reception of the Divine Guest, at length say to us, \"This I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see,\" we may, in St. John\\'s words, \"have confidence towards God.\"',\n",
       " 'It is not my purpose in these Lectures to attempt a historical survey of Christian Mysticism. To attempt this, within the narrow limits of eight Lectures, would oblige me to give a mere skeleton of the subject, which would be of no value, and of very little interest. The aim which I have set before myself is to give a clear presentation of an important type of Christian life and thought, in the hope that it may suggest to us a way towards the solution of some difficulties which at present agitate and divide us. The path is beset with pitfalls on either side, as will be abundantly clear when we consider the startling expressions which Mysticism has often found for itself. But though I have not attempted to give even an outline of the history of Mysticism, I feel that the best and safest way of studying this or any type of religion is to consider it in the light of its historical development, and of the forms which it has actually assumed. And so I have tried to set these Lectures in a historical framework, and, in choosing prominent figures as representatives of the chief kinds of Mysticism, to observe, so far as possible, the chronological order. The present Lecture will carry us down to the Pseudo-Dionysius, the influence of whose writings during the next thousand years can hardly be overestimated. But if we are to understand how a system of speculative Mysticism, of an Asiatic rather than European type, came to be accepted as the work of a convert of St. Paul, and invested with semi-apostolic authority, we must pause for a few minutes to let our eyes rest on the phenomenon called Alexandrianism, which fills a large place in the history of the early Church.',\n",
       " 'It is not worth while to give a detailed account of St. Teresa\\'s mystical theology. Its cardinal points are that the religious life consists in complete conformity to the will of God, so that at last the human will becomes purely \"passive\" and \"at rest\"; and the belief in Christ as the sole ground of salvation, on which subject she uses language which is curiously like that of the Lutheran Reformers. Her teaching about passivity and the \"prayer of quiet\" is identical with that which the Pope afterwards condemned in Molinos; but it is only fair to remember that Teresa was not canonised for her theology, but for her life, and that the Roman Church is not committed to every doctrine which can be found in the writings of her saints. The real character of St. Teresa\\'s piety may be seen best in some of her prayers, such as this which follows:--',\n",
       " 'It is quite true that the later mystics have been cheerful and optimistic. But those who have found a kingdom in their own minds, and who have enough strength of character \"to live by reason and not by opinion,\" as Whichcote says (in a maxim which was anticipated by that arch-enemy of Mysticism--Epicurus), are likely to be happier than other men. And, moreover, Wordsworth teaches us that almost, if not quite, every evil may be so transmuted by the \"faculty which abides within the soul,\" that those \"interpositions which would hide and darken\" may \"become contingencies of pomp, and serve to exalt her native brightness\"; even as the moon, \"rising behind a thick and lofty grove, turns the dusky veil into a substance glorious as her own.\" So the happy warrior is made \"more compassionate\" by the scenes of horror which he is compelled to witness. Whether this healing and purifying effect of sorrow points the way to a solution of the problem of evil or not, it is a high and noble faith, the one and only consolation which we feel not to be a mockery when we are in great trouble.',\n",
       " 'It is stating the same paradox in another form to say that we can only achieve inner unity by transcending mere individuality. The independent, impervious self shows its unreality by being inwardly discordant. It is of no use to enlarge the circumference of our life, if the fixed centre is always the ego. There are, if I may press the metaphor, other circles with other centres, in which we are vitally involved. And thus sympathy, or love, which is sympathy in its highest power, is the great atoner, within as well as without. The old Pythagorean maxim, that \"a man must be one,[53]\" is echoed by all the mystics. He must be one as God is one, and the world is one; for man is a microcosm, a living mirror of the universe. Here, once more, we have a characteristic mystical doctrine, which is perhaps worked out most fully in the \"Fons Vitæ\" of Avicebron (Ibn Gebirol), a work which had great influence in the Middle Ages. The doctrine justifies the use of analogy in matters of religion, and is of great importance. One might almost dare to say that all conclusions about the world above us which are not based on the analogy of our own mental experiences, are either false or meaningless.',\n",
       " 'It is very significant that the mystics, who had undermined sacerdotalism, and in many other ways prepared the Reformation, were shouldered aside when the secession from Rome had to be organised. The Lutheran Church was built by other hands. And yet the mystics of Luther\\'s generation, Carlstadt and Sebastian Frank, are far from deserving the contemptuous epithets which Luther showered upon them. Carlstadt endeavoured to deepen the Lutheran notion of faith by bringing it into closer connexion with the love of God to man and of man to God; Sebastian Frank developed the speculative system of Eckhart and Tauler in an original and interesting manner. But speculative Mysticism is a powerful solvent, and Protestant Churches are too ready to fall to pieces even without it. \"I will not even answer such men as Frank,\" said Luther in 1545; \"I despise them too much. If my nose does not deceive me, he is an enthusiast or spiritualist, who is content with nothing but Spirit, spirit, spirit, and cares not at all for Bible, Sacrament, or Preaching.\" The teaching which the sixteenth century spurned so contemptuously was almost identical with that of Eckhart and Tauler, whose names were still revered. But it was not wanted just then. It was not till the next generation, when superstitious veneration for the letter of Scripture was bringing back some of the evils of the unreformed faith, that Mysticism in the person of Valentine Weigel was able to resume its true task in the deepening and spiritualising of religion in Germany.',\n",

The author of the German Theology is equally emphatic in his warnings against the \"false light\"; and Ruysbroek\\'s denunciation of the Brethren of the Free Spirit has already been quoted. Tauler, in an interesting sermon[277], describes the heady arrogance, disorderly conduct, and futile idleness of these fanatics, and then gives the following maxims, by which we may distinguish the false Mysticism from the true. \"Now let us know how we may escape these snares of the enemy. No one can be free from the observance of the laws of God and the practice of virtue. No one can unite himself to God in emptiness without true love and desire for God. No one can be holy without becoming holy, without good works. No one may leave off doing good works. No one may rest in God without love for God. No one can be exalted to a stage which he has not longed for or felt.\" Finally, he shows how the example of Christ forbids all the errors which he is combating.',\n",

This, however, need cause no confusion, for the Platonists had no direct influence upon Law. Law, Nonjuror as well as mystic, remained a High Churchman by sympathy, and hated Rationalism; while the Platonists sprang from an Evangelical school, were never tired of extolling Reason, and regarded Böhme as a fanciful \"enthusiast.[357]\" And yet, we find so very much in common between the Platonists and William Law, that these party differences seem merely superficial.

He began by deliberately crushing, not only the ardent passions to which he tells us that he was naturally prone, but all ambition and love of money, determining to confine himself to \"such objects as excite no morbid passions, no disquietude, no vengeance, and no hatred,\" and found his reward in a settled state of calm serenity, in which all the thoughts flow like a clear fountain, and have forgotten how to hate and how to despise.[376]',\n",

After studying at Cologne and Paris, he returned to Strassburg, where, as a Dominican, he was allowed to officiate as a priest, although the town was involved in the great interdict of 1324. In 1339, however, he had to fly to Basel, which was the headquarters of the revivalist society who called themselves \"the Friends of God.\" About 1346 he returned to Strassburg, and was devoted in his ministrations during the \"black death\" in 1348. He appears to have been strongly influenced by one of the Friends of God, a mysterious layman, who has been identified, probably wrongly, with Nicholas of Basel,[264] and, according to some, dated his \"conversion\" from his acquaintance with this saintly man.

He was the object of great veneration in the later part of his life. Ruysbroek was not a learned man, or a clear thinker.[258] He knew Dionysius, St. Augustine, and Eckhart, and was no doubt acquainted with some of the other mystical writers; but he does not write like a scholar or a man of letters. He resembles Suso in being more emotional and less speculative than most of the German school.',\n",

       " 'Let us consider briefly, first, what we learn from this Gospel about the nature of God, and then its teaching upon human salvation.',\n",
       " 'Let us now turn to the human side of salvation, and trace the upward path of the Christian life as presented to us in this Gospel. First, then, we have the doctrine of the new birth: \"Except a man be born anew (or, from above), he cannot see the kingdom of God.\" This is further explained as a being born \"of water and of the Spirit\"--words which are probably meant to remind us of the birth of the world-order out of chaos as described in Genesis, and also to suggest the two ideas of purification and life. (Baptism, as a symbol of purification, was, of course, already familiar to those who first heard the words.) Then we have a doctrine of faith which is deeper than that of the Synoptists. The very expression [Greek: pisteuein eis], \"to believe on,\" common in St. John and rare elsewhere, shows that the word is taking a new meaning. Faith, in St. John, is no longer regarded chiefly as a condition of supernatural favours; or, rather, the mountains which it can remove are no material obstructions. It is an act of the whole personality, a self-dedication to Christ. It must precede knowledge: \"If any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching,\" is the promise. It is the \"credo ut intelligam\" of later theology. The objection has been raised that St. John\\'s teaching about faith moves in a vicious circle. His appeal is to the inward witness; and those who cannot hear this inward witness are informed that they must first believe, which is just what they can find no reason for doing. But this criticism misses altogether the drift of St. John\\'s teaching. Faith, for him, is not the acceptance of a proposition upon evidence; still less is it the acceptance of a proposition in the teeth of evidence. It is, in the first instance, the resolution \"to stand or fall by the noblest hypothesis\"; that is (may we not say?), to follow Christ wherever He may lead us. Faith begins with an experiment, and ends with an experience.[65] \"He that believeth in Him hath the witness in himself\"; that is the verification which follows the venture. That even the power to make the experiment is given from above; and that the experience is not merely subjective, but an universal law which has had its supreme vindication in history,--these are two facts which we learn afterwards. The converse process, which begins with a critical examination of documents, cannot establish what we really want to know, however strong the evidence may be. In this sense, and in this only, are Tennyson\\'s words true, that \"nothing worthy proving can be proven, nor yet disproven.\"',\n",
       " 'Like other Protestant mystics, he lays great stress on the indwelling presence of Christ. And, consistently with this belief, he revolts against the Calvinistic doctrine of imputed righteousness, very much as did the Cambridge Platonists a little later. \"That man is no Christian,\" he says, \"who doth merely comfort himself with the suffering, death, and satisfaction of Christ, and doth impute it to himself as a gift of favour, remaining himself still a wild beast and unregenerate.... If this said sacrifice is to avail for me, it must be wrought in me. The Father must beget His Son in my desire of faith, that my faith\\'s hunger may apprehend Him in His word of promise. Then I put Him on, in His entire process of justification, in my inward ground; and straightway there begins in me the killing of the wrath of the devil, death, and hell, from the inward power of Christ\\'s death. I am inwardly dead, and He is my life; I live in Him, and not in my selfhood. I am an instrument of God, wherewith He doeth what He will.\" To the same effect William Law says, \"Christ given for us is neither more nor less than Christ given into us. He is in no other sense our full, perfect, and sufficient Atonement, than as His nature and spirit are born and formed in us.\" Law also insists that the Atonement was the effect, not of the wrath, but of the love of God. \"Neither reason nor scripture,\" he says, \"will allow us to bring wrath into God Himself, as a temper of His mind, who is only infinite, unalterable, overflowing Love.\" \"Wrath is atoned when sin is extinguished.\" This revolt against the forensic theory of the Atonement is very characteristic of Protestant Mysticism.[352]',\n",
       " 'Like other mystics, he insists that love, when perfect, is independent of the hope of reward, and he shows great freedom in handling Purgatory, Hell, and Heaven. They are states, not places; separation from God is the misery of hell, and each man is his own judge. \"We would spiritualise everything,\" he says, with especial reference to Holy Scripture.[254]',\n",

It has been abundantly proved that neither Romanism nor Protestantism, regarded as alternatives, possesses enough of the truth to satisfy the religious needs of the present day. But is it not probable that, as the theology of the Fourth Gospel acted as a reconciling principle between the opposing sections in the early Church, so it may be found to contain the teaching which is most needed by both parties in our own communion? In St. John and St. Paul we find all the principles of a sound and sober Christian Mysticism; and it is to these \"fresh springs\" of the spiritual life that we must turn, if the Church is to renew her youth.',\n",
       " 'Molinos begins by saying that there are two ways to the knowledge of God--meditation or discursive thought, and \"pure faith\" or contemplation. Contemplation has two stages, active and passive, the latter being the higher.[302] Meditation he also calls the \"exterior road\"; it is good for beginners, he says, but can never lead to perfection. The \"interior road,\" the goal of which is union with God, consists in complete resignation to the will of God, annihilation of all self-will, and an unruffled tranquillity or passivity of soul, until the mystical grace is supernaturally \"infused.\" Then \"we shall sink and lose ourselves in the immeasurable sea of God\\'s infinite goodness, and rest there steadfast and immovable.[303]\" He gives a list of tokens by which we may know that we are called from meditation to contemplation; and enumerates four means, which lead to perfection and inward peace--prayer, obedience, frequent communions, and inner mortification. The best kind of prayer is the prayer of silence;[304] and there are three silences, that of words, that of desires, and that of thought. In the last and highest the mind is a blank, and God alone speaks to the soul.[305] With the curious passion for subdivision which we find in nearly all Romish mystics, he distinguishes three kinds of \"infusa contemplazione\"--(1) satiety, when the soul is filled with God and conceives a hatred for all worldly things; (2) \"un mentale eccesso\" or elevation of the soul, born of Divine love and its satiety; (3) \"security.\" In this state the soul would willingly even go to hell, if it were God\\'s will. \"Happy is the state of that soul which has slain and annihilated itself.\" It lives no longer in itself, for God lives in it. \"With all truth we may say that it is deified.\"',\n",
       " 'Molinos follows St. Juan of the Cross in disparaging visions, which he says are often snares of the devil. And, like him, he says much of the \"horrible temptations and torments, worse than any which the martyrs of the early Church underwent,\" which form part of \"purgative contemplation.\" He resembles the Spanish mystics also in his insistence on outward observances, especially \"daily communion, when possible,\" but thinks frequent confession unnecessary, except for beginners.',\n",
       " 'Molinos had written with the object of \"breaking the fetters\" which hindered souls in their upward course. Unfortunately for himself, he also loosened some of the fetters in which the Roman priesthood desires to keep the laity[306]. And so, instead of the honours which had been grudgingly and suspiciously bestowed on his predecessors, Molinos ended his days in a dungeon[307]. His condemnation was followed by a sharp persecution of his followers in Italy, who had become very numerous; and, in France, Bossuet procured the condemnation and imprisonment of Madame Guyon, a lady of high character and abilities, who was the centre of a group of quietists. Madame de Guyon need not detain us here. Her Mysticism is identical with that of Saint Teresa, except that she was no visionary, and that her character was softer and less masculine. Her attractive personality, and the cruel and unjust treatment which she experienced during the greater part of her life, arouse the sympathy of all who read her story; but since my present object is not to exhibit a portrait gallery of eminent mystics, but to investigate the chief types of mystical thought, it will not be necessary for me to describe her life or make extracts from her writings. The character of her quietism may be illustrated by one example--the hymn on \"The Acquiescence of Pure Love,\" translated by Cowper:--',\n",
       " 'Most of the errors which have so grievously obscured the true nature of this sacrament have proceeded from attempts to answer the question, \"How does the reception of the consecrated elements affect the inner state of the receiver?\" To those who hold the symbolic view, as I understand it, it seems clear that the question of cause and effect must be resolutely cast aside. The reciprocal action of spirit and matter is the one great mystery which, to all appearance, must remain impenetrable to the finite intelligence. We do not ask whether the soul is the cause of the body, or the body of the soul; we only know that the two are found, in experience, always united. In the same way we should abstain, I think, from speculating on the effect of the sacraments, and train ourselves instead to consider them as divinely-ordered symbols, by which the Church, as an organic whole, and we as members of it, realise the highest and deepest of our spiritual privileges.',\n",
       " 'Most of this would have been accepted as precious truth by the mediæval Church mystics.[177] The words nakedness, darkness, nothingness, passivity, apathy, and the like, fill their pages. We shall find that this time-honoured phraseology was adhered to long after the grave moral dangers which beset this type of Mysticism had been recognised. Tauler, for instance, who lays the axe to the root of the tree by saying, \"Christ never arrived at the emptiness of which these men talk,\" repeats the old jargon for pages together. German Mysticism really rested on another basis, and when Luther had the courage to break with ecclesiastical tradition, the via negativa rapidly disappeared within the sphere of his influence.',\n",
       " 'My other example of English Mysticism in the Middle Ages is Julian or Juliana of Norwich,[281] to whom were granted a series of \"revelations\" in the year 1373, she being then about thirty years old. She describes with evident truthfulness the manner in which the visions came to her. She ardently desired to have a \"bodily sight\" of her Lord upon the Cross, \"like other that were Christ\\'s lovers\"; and she prayed that she might have \"a grievous sickness almost unto death,\" to wean her from the world and quicken her spiritual sense. The sickness came, and the vision; for they thought her dying, and held the crucifix before her, till the figure on the Cross changed into the semblance of the living Christ. \"All this was showed by three parts--that is to say, by bodily sight, and by words formed in my understanding, and by ghostly sight.[282]\" \"But the ghostly sight I cannot nor may not show it as openly nor as fully as I would.\" Her later visions came to her sometimes during sleep, but most often when she was awake. The most pure and certain were wrought by a \"Divine illapse\" into the spiritual part of the soul, the mind and understanding, for these the devil cannot counterfeit. Juliana was certainly perfectly honest and perfectly sane. The great charm of her little book is the sunny hopefulness and happiness which shines from every page, and the tender affection for her suffering Lord which mingles with her devotion without ever becoming morbid or irreverent. It is also interesting to see how this untaught maiden (for she shows no traces of book learning) is led by the logic of the heart straight to some of the speculative doctrines which we have found in the philosophical mystics. The brief extracts which follow will illustrate all these statements.',\n",
       " 'Mystical theology differs from speculative (i.e. scholastic), in that mystical theology belongs to the affective faculties, not the cognitive; that it does not depend on logic, and is therefore open even to the ignorant; that it is not open to the unbelieving, since it rests upon faith and love; and that it brings peace, whereas speculation breeds unrest.',\n",
       " 'Mysticism is not itself a philosophy, any more than it is itself a religion. On its intellectual side it has been called \"formless speculation.[35]\" But until speculations or intuitions have entered into the forms of our thought, they are not current coin even for the thinker. The part played by Mysticism in philosophy is parallel to the part played by it in religion. As in religion it appears in revolt against dry formalism and cold rationalism, so in philosophy it takes the field against materialism and scepticism.[36] It is thus possible to speak of speculative Mysticism, and even to indicate certain idealistic lines of thought, which may without entire falsity be called the philosophy of Mysticism. In this introductory Lecture I can, of course, only hint at these in the barest and most summary manner. And it must be remembered that I have undertaken to-day to delineate the general characteristics of Mysticism, not of Christian Mysticism. I am trying, moreover, in this Lecture to confine myself to those developments which I consider normal and genuine, excluding the numerous aberrant types which we shall encounter in the course of our survey.',\n",
       " 'Noack\\'s definition is, perhaps, not very happily phrased, for the essence of Mysticism is not speculation but intuition; and when it begins to speculate, it is obliged at once to take to itself \"forms.\" Even the ultimate goal of the via negativa is apprehended as \"a kind of form of formlessness.\" Goethe\\'s definition regards Mysticism as a system of religion or philosophy, and from this point of view describes it accurately.',\n",
       " 'None of the writers with whom we have to deal can fairly be charged with this error, which is subversive of the very foundations of true religion. Eckhart, carried away by his love of paradox, allows himself occasionally to make statements which, if logically developed, would come perilously near to it; and Emerson\\'s philosophy is more seriously compromised in this direction. Dionysius is in no such danger, for the simple reason that he stands too near to Plato. The pantheistic tendency of mediæval Realism requires a few words of explanation, especially as I have placed the name of Plato at the head of this Lecture. Plato\\'s doctrine of ideas aimed at establishing the transcendence of the highest Idea--that of God. But the mediæval doctrine of ideas, as held by the extreme Realists, sought to find room in the summum genus for a harmonious coexistence of all things. It thus tended towards Pantheism;[182] while the Aristotelian Realists maintained the substantial character of individuals outside the Being of God. \"This view,\" says Eicken, \"which quite inverted the historical and logical relation of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies, was maintained till the close of the Middle Ages.\"',\n",
       " 'Nor would it be fair to say that this argument makes religion depend merely on feeling. A theology based on mere feeling is (as Hegel said) as much contrary to revealed religion as to rational knowledge. The fact that God is present to our feeling is no proof that He exists; our feelings include imaginations which have no reality corresponding to them. No, it is not feeling, but the heart or reason (whichever term we prefer), which speaks with authority. By the heart or reason I mean the whole personality acting in concord, an abiding mood of thinking, willing, and feeling. The life of the spirit perhaps begins with mere feeling, and perhaps will be consummated in mere feeling, when \"that which is in part shall be done away\"; but during its struggles to enter into its full inheritance, it gathers up into itself the activities of all the faculties, which act harmoniously together in proportion as the organism to which they belong is in a healthy state.',\n",
       " 'Now it will be found that these men of acknowledged and pre-eminent saintliness agree very closely in what they tell us about God. They tell us that they have arrived gradually at an unshakable conviction, not based on inference but on immediate experience, that God is a Spirit with whom the human spirit can hold intercourse; that in Him meet all that they can imagine of goodness, truth, and beauty; that they can see His footprints everywhere in nature, and feel His presence within them as the very life of their life, so that in proportion as they come to themselves they come to Him. They tell us that what separates us from Him and from happiness is, first, self-seeking in all its forms; and, secondly, sensuality in all its forms; that these are the ways of darkness and death, which hide from us the face of God; while the path of the just is like a shining light, which shineth more and more unto the perfect day. As they have toiled up the narrow way, the Spirit has spoken to them of Christ, and has enlightened the eyes of their understandings, till they have at least begun to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, and to be filled with all the fulness of God.',\n",
       " 'Of prayer he says, \"We pray as much as we desire, and we desire as much as we love.\" Vocal prayer cannot be (as the extreme quietists pretend) useless to contemplative souls; \"for Christ has taught us a vocal prayer.\"',\n",
       " 'Of the Greek Fathers who followed Athanasius, I have only room to mention Gregory of Nyssa, who defends the historical incarnation in true mystical fashion by an appeal to spiritual experience. \"We all believe that the Divine is in everything, pervading and embracing it, and dwelling in it. Why then do men take offence at the dispensation of the mystery taught by the Incarnation of God, who is not, even now, outside of mankind?... If the form of the Divine presence is not now the same, we are as much agreed that God is among us to-day, as that He was in the world then.\" He argues in another place that all other species of spiritual beings must have had their Incarnations of Christ; a doctrine which was afterwards condemned, but which seems to follow necessarily from the Logos doctrine. These arguments show very clearly that for the Greek theologians Christ is a cosmic principle, immanent in the world, though not confined by it; and that the scheme of salvation is regarded as part of the constitution of the universe, which is animated and sustained by the same Power who was fully manifested in the Incarnation.',\n",
       " 'Of the other books of the New Testament it is not necessary to say much. The Epistle to the Hebrews cannot be the work of St. Paul. It shows strong traces of Jewish Alexandrianism; indeed, the writer seems to have been well acquainted with the Book of Wisdom and with Philo. Alexandrian idealism is always ready to pass into speculative Mysticism, but the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews can hardly be called mystical in the sense in which St. Paul was a mystic. The most interesting side of his theology, from our present point of view, is the way in which he combines his view of religious ordinances as types and adumbrations of higher spiritual truths, with a comprehensive view of history as a progressive realisation of a Divine scheme. The keynote of the book is that mankind has been educated partly by ceremonial laws and partly by \"promises.\" Systems of laws and ordinances, of which the Jewish Law is the chief example, have their place in history. They rightly claim obedience until the practical lessons which they can teach have been learned, and until the higher truths which they conceal under the protecting husk of symbolism can be apprehended without disguise. Then their task is done, and mankind is no longer bound by them. In the same way, the \"promises\" which were made under the old dispensation proved to be only symbols of deeper and more spiritual blessings, which in the moral childhood of humanity would not have appeared desirable; they were (not delusions, but) illusions, \"God having prepared some better thing\" to take their place. The doctrine is one of profound and far-reaching importance. In this Epistle it is certainly connected with the idealistic thought that all visible things are symbols, and that every truth apprehended by finite intelligences must be only the husk of a deeper truth. We may therefore claim the Epistle to the Hebrews as containing in outline a Christian philosophy of history, based upon a doctrine of symbols which has much in common with some later developments of Mysticism.',\n",
       " 'On the former, Fénelon\\'s teaching may be summarised as follows: Self-interest must be excluded from our love of God, for self-love is the root of all evil. This predominant desire for God\\'s glory need not be always explicit--it need only become so on extraordinary occasions; but it must always be implicit. There are five kinds of love for God: (i.) purely servile--the love of God\\'s gifts apart from Himself; (ii.) the love of mere covetousness, which regards the love of God only as the condition of happiness; (iii.) that of hope, in which the desire for our own welfare is still predominant; (iv.) interested love, which is still mixed with self-regarding motives; (v.) disinterested love. He mentions here the \"three lives\" of the mystics, and says that in the purgative life love is mixed with the fear of hell; in the illuminative, with the hope of heaven; while in the highest stage \"we are united to God in the peaceable exercise of pure love.\" \"If God were to will to send the souls of the just to hell--so Chrysostom and Clement suggest--souls in the third state would not love Him less[308].\" \"Mixed love,\" however, is not a sin: \"the greater part of holy souls never reach perfect disinterestedness in this life.\" We ought to wish for our salvation, because it is God\\'s will that we should do so. Interested love coincides with resignation, disinterested with holy indifference. \"St. Francis de Sales says that the disinterested heart is like wax in the hands of its God.\"',\n",
       " 'On the other side stand the majority of the earlier mystics. Believing that God is \"closer to us than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet,\" they are impatient of any intermediaries. \"We need not search for His footprints in Nature, when we can behold His face in ourselves,[44]\" is their answer to St. Augustine\\'s fine expression that all things bright and beautiful in the world are \"footprints of the uncreated Wisdom.[45]\" Coleridge has expressed their feeling in his \"Ode to Dejection\"--',\n",
       " 'Once more, this reliance on the inner light does not mean that every man must be his own prophet, his own priest, and his own saviour. The individual is not independent of the Church, nor the Church of the historical Christ. But the Church is a living body and the Incarnation and Atonement are living facts still in operation. They are part of the eternal counsels of God; and whether they are enacted in the Abyss of the Divine Nature, or once for all in their fulness on the stage of history, or in miniature, as it were, in your soul and mine, the process is the same, and the tremendous importance of those historical facts which our creeds affirm is due precisely to the fact that they are not unique and isolated portents, but the supreme manifestation of the grandest and most universal laws.',\n",
       " 'One more point must be mentioned before we leave St. Augustine. In spite of, or rather because of, his Platonism, he had nothing but contempt for the later Neoplatonism, the theurgic and theosophic apparatus of Iamblichus and his friends. I have said nothing yet about the extraordinary development of magic in all its branches, astrology, necromancy, table-rapping, and other kinds of divination, charms and amulets and witchcraft, which brought ridicule upon the last struggles of paganism. These aberrations of Nature-Mysticism will be dealt with in their later developments in my seventh Lecture. St. Augustine, after mentioning some nonsensical incantations of the \"abracadabra\" kind, says, \"A Christian old woman is wiser than these philosophers.\" In truth, the spirit of Plato lived in, and not outside Christianity, even in the time of Porphyry. And on the cultus of angels and spirits, which was closely connected with theurgic superstition, St. Augustine\\'s judgment is very instructive. \"Whom should I find,\" he asks, \"to reconcile me to Thee? Should I approach the angels? With what prayers, with what rites? Many, as I hear, have tried this method, and have come to crave for curious visions, and have been deceived, as they deserved.[209]\"',\n",
       " 'One of the best chapters in her autobiography, and perhaps the most interesting from our present point of view, is the allegory under which she describes the different kinds of prayer. The simile is not original--it appears in St. Augustine and others; but it is more fully worked out by St. Teresa, who tells us \"it has always been a great delight to me to think of my soul as a garden, and of the Lord as walking in it.\" So here she says, \"Our soul is like a garden, rough and unfruitful, out of which God plucks the weeds, and plants flowers, which we have to water by prayer. There are four ways of doing this--First, by drawing the water from a well; this is the earliest and most laborious process. Secondly, by a water-wheel which has its rim hung round with little buckets. Third, by causing a stream to flow through it. Fourth, by rain from heaven. The first is ordinary prayer, which is often attended by great sweetness and comfort. But sometimes the well is dry. What then? The love of God does not consist in being able to weep, nor yet in delights and tenderness, but in serving with justice, courage, and humility. The other seems to me rather to receive than to give. The second is the prayer of quiet, when the soul understands that God is so near to her that she need not talk aloud to Him.\" In this stage the Will is absorbed, but the Understanding and Memory are still active. (Teresa, following the scholastic mystics, makes these the three faculties of the soul.) In the third stage God becomes, as it were, the Gardener. \"It is a sleep of the faculties, which are not entirely suspended, nor yet do they understand how they work.\" In the fourth stage, the soul labours not at all; all the faculties are quiescent. As she pondered how she might describe this state, \"the Lord said these words to me: She (the soul) unmakes herself, my daughter, to bring herself closer to Me. It is no more she that lives, but I. As she cannot comprehend what she sees, understanding she ceases to understand.\" Years after she had attained this fourth stage, Teresa experienced what the mystics call \"the great dereliction,\" a sense of ineffable loneliness and desolation, which nevertheless is the path to incomparable happiness. It was accompanied by a kind of catalepsy, with muscular rigidity and cessation of the pulses.',\n",
       " 'Origen follows Clement in his division of the religious life into two classes or stages, those of faith and knowledge. He draws too hard a line between them, and speaks with a professorial arrogance of the \"popular, irrational faith\" which leads to \"somatic Christianity,\" as opposed to the \"spiritual Christianity\" conferred by Gnosis or Wisdom.[122] He makes it only too clear that by \"somatic Christianity\" he means that faith which is based on the gospel history. Of teaching founded upon the historical narrative, he says, \"What better method could be devised to assist the masses?\" The Gnostic or Sage no longer needs the crucified Christ. The \"eternal\" or \"spiritual\" Gospel, which is his possession, \"shows clearly all things concerning the Son of God Himself, both the mysteries shown by His words, and the things of which His acts were the symbols.[123]\" It is not that he denies or doubts the truth of the Gospel history, but he feels that events which only happened once can be of no importance, and regards the life, death, and resurrection of Christ as only one manifestation of an universal law, which was really enacted, not in this fleeting world of shadows, but in the eternal counsels of the Most High. He considers that those who are thoroughly convinced of the universal truths revealed by the Incarnation and Atonement, need trouble themselves no more about their particular manifestations in time.',\n",
       " \"Origen supplies some valuable links in the history of speculative Mysticism, but his mind was less inclined to mystical modes of thought than was Clement's. I can here only touch upon a few points which bear directly upon our subject.\",\n",
       " 'Origen, like the Neoplatonists, says that God is above or beyond Being; but he is sounder than Clement on this point, for he attributes self-consciousness[124] and reason to God, who therefore does not require the Second Person in order to come to Himself. Also, since God is not wholly above reason, He can be approached by reason, and not only by ecstatic vision.',\n",
       " 'Our Lord\\'s precept, \"Consider the lilies,\" sanctions this religious use of Nature; and many of His parables, such as that of the Sower, show us how much we may learn from such analogies. And be it observed that it is the normal and regular in Nature which in these parables is presented for our study; the yearly harvest, not the three years\\' famine; the constant care and justice of God, not the \"special providence\" or the \"special judgment.\" We need not wait for catastrophes to trace the finger of God. As for Christian poetry and art, we do not expect to find any theory of æsthetic in the New Testament; but we may perhaps extract from the precept quoted above the canon that the highest beauty that we can discern resides in the real and natural, and only demands the seeing eye to find it.',\n",
       " 'Pantheism, as I understand the word, is a pitfall for Mysticism to avoid, not an error involved in its first principles. But we need not quarrel with those who have said that speculative Mysticism is the Christian form of Pantheism. For there is much truth in Amiel\\'s dictum, that \"Christianity, if it is to triumph over Pantheism, must absorb it.\" Those are no true friends to the cause of religion who would base it entirely upon dogmatic supernaturalism. The passion for facts which are objective, isolated, and past, often prevents us from seeing facts which are eternal and spiritual. We cry, \"Lo here,\" and \"Lo there,\" and forget that the kingdom of God is within us and amongst us. The great service rendered by the speculative mystics to the Christian Church lies in their recognition of those truths which Pantheism grasps only to destroy.',\n",
       " 'Persecution, when applied with sufficient ruthlessness, seldom fails of its immediate object. It took only about twelve years to destroy Protestantism in Spain; and the Holy Office was equally successful in binding Mysticism hand and foot.[294] And so we must not expect to find in St. Teresa or St. Juan any of the characteristic independence of Mysticism. The inner light which they sought was not an illumination of the intellect in its search for truth, but a consuming fire to burn up all earthly passions and desires. Faith presented them with no problems; all such questions had been settled once for all by Holy Church. They were ascetics first and Church Reformers next; neither of them was a typical mystic.[295]',\n",
       " 'Philo\\'s ethical system is that of the later contemplative Mysticism. Knowledge and virtue can be obtained only by renunciation of self. Contemplation is a higher state than activity. \"The soul should cut off its right hand.\" \"It should shun the whirlpool of life, and not even touch it with the tip of a finger.\" The highest stage is when a man leaves behind his finite self-consciousness, and sees God face to face, standing in Him from henceforward, and knowing Him not by reason, but by clear certainty. Philo makes no attempt to identify the Logos with the Jewish Messiah, and leaves no room for an Incarnation.',\n",
       " 'Philo\\'s object is to reconcile religion and philosophy--in other words, Moses and Plato.[113] His method[114] is to make Platonism a development of Mosaism, and Mosaism an implicit Platonism. The claims of orthodoxy are satisfied by saying, rather audaciously, \"All this is Moses\\' doctrine, not mine.\" His chief instrument in this difficult task is allegorism, which in his hands is a bad specimen of that pseudo-science which has done so much to darken counsel in biblical exegesis. His speculative system, however, is exceedingly interesting.',\n",
       " 'Pico de Mirandola (born 1463) was the first to bring the Cabbala into Christian philosophy, and to unite it with his Neoplatonism. Very characteristic of his age is the declaration that \"there is no natural science which makes us so certain of the Divinity of Christ as Magic and the Cabbala.[341]\" For there was at that period a curious alliance of Mysticism and natural science against scholasticism, which had kept both in galling chains; and both mystics and physicists invoked the aid of Jewish theosophy. Just as Pythagoras, Plato, and Proclus were set up against Aristotle, so the occult philosophy of the Jews, which on its speculative side was mere Neoplatonism, was set up against the divinity of the Schoolmen. In Germany, Reuchlin (1455-1522) wrote a treatise, On the Cabbalistic Art, in which a theological scheme resembling those of the Neoplatonists and speculative mystics was based on occult revelation. The book captivated Pope Leo X. and the early Reformers alike.',\n",
       " 'Plotinus\\' Trinity are the One or the Good, who is above existence, God as the Absolute; the Intelligence, who occupies the sphere of real existence, organic unity comprehending multiplicity--the One-Many, as he calls it, or, as we might call it, God as thought, God existing in and for Himself; and the Soul, the One and Many, occupying the sphere of appearance or imperfect reality--God as action. Soulless matter, which only exists as a logical abstraction, is arrived at by looking at things \"in disconnexion, dull and spiritless.\" It is the sphere of the \"merely many,\" and is zero, as \"the One who is not\" is Infinity.',\n",
       " 'Primitive Animism believes in no natural laws. The next stage is to believe in laws which are frequently suspended by the intervention of an independent and superior power. Mediæval dualism regarded every breach of natural law as a vindication of the power of spirit over matter--not always, however, of Divine power, for evil spirits could produce very similar disturbances of the physical order. Thus arose that persistent tendency to \"seek after a sign,\" in which the religion of the vulgar, even in our own day, is deeply involved. Miracle, in some form or other, is regarded as the real basis of belief in God. At this stage people never ask themselves whether any spiritual truth, or indeed anything worth knowing, could possibly be communicated or authenticated by thaumaturgic exhibitions. What attracts them at first is the evidence which these beliefs furnish, that the world in which they live is not entirely under the dominion of an unconscious or inflexible power, but that behind the iron mechanism of cause and effect is a will more like their own in its irregularity and arbitrariness. Afterwards, as the majesty of law dawns upon them, miracles are no longer regarded as capricious exercises of power, but as the operation of higher physical laws, which are only active on rare occasions. A truer view sees in them a materialisation of mystical symbols, the proper function of which is to act as interpreters between the real and the apparent, between the spiritual and material worlds. When they crystallise as portents, they lose all their usefulness. Moreover, the belief in celestial visitations has its dark counterpart in superstitious dread of the powers of evil, which is capable of turning life into a long nightmare, and has led to dreadful cruelties[333]. The error has still enough vitality to create a prejudice against natural science, which appears in the light of an invading enemy wresting province after province from the empire of the supernatural.',\n",
       " 'Proceeding a little further as we trace the development of natural or objective religion, we come to the belief in magic, which in primitive peoples is closely associated with their first attempts at experimental science. What gives magic its peculiar character is that it is based on fanciful, and not on real correspondences. The uneducated mind cannot distinguish between associations of ideas which are purely arbitrary and subjective, and those which have a more universal validity. Not, of course, that all the affinities seized upon by primitive man proved illusory; but those which were not so ceased to be magical, and became scientific. The savage draws no distinction between the process by which he makes fire and that by which his priest calls down rain, except that the latter is a professional secret; drugs and spells are used indifferently to cure the sick; astronomy and astrology are parts of the same science. There is, however, a difference between the magic which is purely naturalistic and that which makes mystical claims. The magician sometimes claims that the spirits are subject to him, not because he has learned how to wield the forces which they must obey, but because he has so purged his higher faculties that the occult sympathies of nature have become apparent to him. His theosophy claims to be a spiritual illumination, not a scientific discovery. The error here is the application of spiritual clairvoyance to physical relations. The insight into reality, which is unquestionably the reward of the pure heart and the single eye, does not reveal to us in detail how nature should be subdued to our needs. No spirits from the vasty deep will obey our call, to show us where lies the road to fortune or to ruin. Physical science is an abstract inquiry, which, while it keeps to its proper subject--the investigation of the relations which prevail in the phenomenal world--is self-sufficient, and can receive nothing on external authority. Still less can the adept usurp Divine powers, and bend the eternal laws of the universe to his puny will.',\n",
       " 'Ruysbroek reverts to the mystical tradition, partially broken by Eckhart, of arranging almost all his topics in three or seven divisions, often forming a progressive scale. For instance, in the treatise \"On the Seven Grades of Love,\" we have the following series, which he calls the \"Ladder of Love\": (1) goodwill; (2) voluntary poverty; (3) chastity; (4) humility; (5) desire for the glory of God; (6) Divine contemplation, which has three properties--intuition, purity of spirit, and nudity of mind; (7) the ineffable, unnameable transcendence of all knowledge and thought. This arbitrary schematism is the weakest part of Ruysbroek\\'s writings, which contain many deep thoughts. His chief work, Ordo spiritualium nuptiarum, is one of the most complete charts of the mystic\\'s progress which exist. The three stages are here the active life (vita actuosa), the internal, elevated, or affective life, to which all are not called, and the contemplative life, to which only a few can attain. The three parts of the soul, sensitive, rational, and spiritual, correspond to these three stages. The motto of the active life is the text, \"Ecce sponsus venit; exite obviam ei.\" The Bridegroom \"comes\" three times: He came in the flesh; He comes into us by grace; and He will come to judgment. We must \"go out to meet Him,\" by the three virtues of humility, love, and justice: these are the three virtues which support the fabric of the active life. The ground of all the virtues is humility; thence proceed, in order, obedience, renunciation of our own will, patience, gentleness, piety, sympathy, bountifulness, strength and impulse for all virtues, soberness and temperance, chastity. \"This is the active life, which is necessary for us all, if we wish to follow Christ, and to reign with Him in His everlasting kingdom.\"',\n",
       " 'Ruysbroek, it is plain, had no qualms in using the old mystical language without qualification. This is the more remarkable, because he was fully aware of the disastrous consequences which follow from the method of negation and self-deification. For Ruysbroek was an earnest reformer of abuses. He spares no one--popes, bishops, monks, and the laity are lashed in vigorous language for their secularity, covetousness, and other faults; but perhaps his sharpest castigation is reserved for the false mystics. There are some, he says, who mistake mere laziness for holy abstraction; others give the rein to \"spiritual self-indulgence\"; others neglect all religious exercises; others fall into antinomianism, and \"think that nothing is forbidden to them\"--\"they will gratify any appetite which interrupts their contemplation\": these are \"by far the worst of all.\" \"There is another error,\" he proceeds, \"of those who like to call themselves \\'theopaths.\\' They take every impulse to be Divine, and repudiate all responsibility. Most of them live in inert sloth.\" As a corrective to these errors, he very rightly says, \"Christ must be the rule and pattern of all our lives\"; but he does not see that there is a deep inconsistency between the imitation of Christ as the living way to the Father, and the \"negative road\" which leads to vacancy.[259]',\n",
       " 'Récéjac\\'s very interesting Essai sur les Fondements de la Connaissance mystique has the great merit of emphasising the symbolic character of all mystical phenomena, and of putting all such experiences in their true place, as neither hallucinations nor invasions of the natural order, but symbols of a higher reality. \"Les apparitions et autres phénomènes mystiques n\\'existent que dans l\\'esprit du voyant, et ne perdent rien pour cela de leur prix ni de leur vérité.... Et alors n\\'y a-t-il pas au fond des symboles autant d\\'être que sous les phénomènes? Bien plus encore: car l\\'être phénoménal, le réel, se pose dans la conscience par un enchaînement de faits tellement successif que nous ne tenons jamais \\'le même\\'; tandis que sous les symboles, si nous tenons quelque chose, c\\'est l\\'identique et le permanent.\" Récéjac also insists with great force that the motive power of Mysticism is neither curiosity nor self-interest, but love: the intrusion of alien motives is at once fatal to it. \"Its logic consists in having confidence in the rationality of the moral consciousness and its desires.\" This agrees with what I have said--that Reason is, or should be, the logic of our entire personality, and that if Reason is so defined, it does not come into conflict with Mysticism. Récéjac also has much to say upon Free Will and Determinism. He says that Mysticism is an alliance between the Practical Reason (which he identifies with \"la Liberté\") and Imagination. \"Determinism is the opposite, not of \\'Liberty,\\' but of \\'indifference.\\' Liberty, as Fouillée says, is only a higher form of Determinism.\" \"The modern idea of liberty, and the mystical conception of Divine will, may be reconciled in the same way as inspiration and reason, on condition that both are discovered in the same fact interior to us, and that, far from being opposed to each other, they are fused and distinguished together dans quelque implicite réellement présent a la conscience.\" Récéjac throughout appeals to Kant instead of to Hegel as his chief philosophical authority, in this differing from the majority of those who are in sympathy with Mysticism.',\n",
       " 'Scientific Mysticism in the West did not all pass through Dionysius. Victorinus, a Neoplatonic philosopher, was converted to Christianity in his old age, about 360 A.D. The story of his conversion, and the joy which it caused in the Christian community, is told by St. Augustine[188]. He was a deep thinker of the speculative mystical type, but a clumsy and obscure writer, in spite of his rhetorical training. His importance lies in his position as the first Christian Neoplatonist who wrote in Latin.',\n",
       " 'She tells us herself that her reading of St. Augustine\\'s Confessions, at the age of forty-one, was a turning-point in her life. \"When I came to his conversion,\" she says, \"and read how he heard the voice in the garden, it was just as if the Lord called me.\" It was after this that she began again to see visions--or rather to have a sudden sense of the presence of God, with a suspension of all the faculties. In these trances she generally heard Divine \"locutions.\" She says that \"the words were very clearly formed, and unmistakable, though not heard by the bodily ear. They are quite unlike the words framed by the imagination, which are muffled\" (cosa sorda). She describes her visions of Christ very carefully. First He stood beside her while she was in prayer, and she heard and saw Him, \"though not with the eyes of the body, nor of the soul.\" Then by degrees \"His sacred humanity was completely manifested to me, as it is painted after the Resurrection.\" (This last sentence suggests that sacred pictures, lovingly gazed at, may have been the source of some of her visions.) Her superiors tried to persuade her that they were delusions; but she replied, \"If they who said this told me that a person who had just finished speaking to me, whom I knew well, was not that person, but they knew that I fancied it, doubtless I should believe them, rather than what I had seen; but if this person left behind him some jewels as pledges of his great love, and I found myself rich having been poor, I could not believe it if I wished. And these jewels I could show them. For all who knew me saw clearly that my soul was changed; the difference was great and palpable.\" The answer shows that for Teresa the question was not whether the manifestations were \"subjective\" or \"objective,\" but whether they were sent by God or Satan.',\n",
       " 'Since the universe is the thought and will of God expressed under the forms of time and space, everything in it reflects the nature of its Creator, though in different degrees. Erigena says finely, \"Every visible and invisible creature is a theophany or appearance of God.\" The purest mirror in the world is the highest of created things--the human soul unclouded by sin. And this brings us to a point at which Mysticism falls asunder into two classes.',\n",
       " 'So far, the position is unassailable. But the scope of the argument has, of course, its fixed limits. The inner light can only testify to spiritual truths. It always speaks in the present tense; it cannot guarantee any historical event, past or future. It cannot guarantee either the Gospel history or a future judgment. It can tell us that Christ is risen, and that He is alive for evermore, but not that He rose again the third day. It can tell us that the gate of everlasting life is open, but not that the dead shall be raised incorruptible. We have other faculties for investigating the evidence for past events; the inner light cannot certify them immediately, though it can give a powerful support to the external evidence. For though we are in no position to dogmatise about the relations of the temporal to the eternal, one fact does seem to stand out,--that the two are, for us, bound together. If, when we read the Gospels, \"the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit\" that here are the words of eternal life, and the character which alone in history is absolutely flawless, then it is natural for us to believe that there has been, at that point of time, an Incarnation of the Word of God Himself. That the revelation of Christ is an absolute revelation, is a dogmatic statement which, strictly speaking, only the Absolute could make. What we mean by it is that after two thousand years we are unable to conceive of its being ever superseded in any particular. And if anyone finds this inadequate, he may be invited to explain what higher degree of certainty is within our reach. With regard to the future life, the same consideration may help us to understand why the Church has clung to the belief in a literal second coming of Christ to pronounce the dooms of all mankind. But our Lord Himself has taught us that in \"that day and that hour\" lies hidden a more inscrutable mystery than even He Himself, as man, could reveal.',\n",
       " 'Some of these fables are quite obviously due to a materialisation of conventional symbols. These symbols are the picture language into which the imagination translates what the soul has felt. A typical case is that of the miniature image of Christ, which is said to have been found embedded in the heart of a deceased saint. The supposed miracle was, of course, the work of imagination; but this does not mean that those who reported it were deliberate liars. We know now that we must distinguish between observation and imagination, between the language of science and that of poetical metaphor; but in an age which abhorred rationalism this was not so clear[337]. Rationalism has its function in proving that such mystical symbols are not physical facts. But when it goes on to say that they are related to physical facts as morbid hallucinations to realities, it has stepped outside its province.',\n",

       " 'St. Augustine arranges the ascent of the soul in seven stages.[206] But the higher steps are, as usual, purgation, illumination, and union. This last, which he calls \"the vision and contemplation of truth,\" is \"not a step, but the goal of the journey.\" When we have reached it, we shall understand the wholesomeness of the doctrines with which we were fed, as children with milk; the meaning of such \"hard sayings\" as the resurrection of the body will become plain to us. Of the blessedness which attends this state he says elsewhere,[207] \"I entered, and beheld with the mysterious eye of my soul the light that never changes, above the eye of my soul, above my intelligence. It was something altogether different from any earthly illumination. It was higher than my intelligence because it made me, and I was lower because made by it. He who knows the truth knows that light, and he who knows that light knows eternity. Love knows that light.\" And again he says,[208] \"What is this which flashes in upon me, and thrills my heart without wounding it? I tremble and I burn; I tremble, feeling that I am unlike Him; I burn, feeling that I am like Him.\"',\n",
       " 'St. Augustine was not hostile to the idea of a World-Soul; he regards the universe as a living organism;[205] but he often warns his readers against identifying God and the world, or supposing that God is merely immanent in creation. The Neoplatonic teaching about the relation of individual souls to the World-Soul may have helped him to formulate his own teaching about the mystical union of Christians with Christ. His phrase is that Christ and the Church are \"una persona.\"',\n",
       " 'St. John\\'s Mysticism is thus patent to all; it is stamped upon his very style, and pervades all his teaching. Commentators who are in sympathy with this mode of thought have, as we might expect, made the most of this element in the Fourth Gospel. Indeed, some of them, I cannot but think, have interpreted it so completely in the terms of their own idealism, that they have disregarded or explained away the very important qualifications which distinguish the Johannine theology from some later mystical systems. Fichte, for example, claims St. John as a supporter of his system of subjective idealism (if that is a correct description of it), and is driven to some curious bits of exegesis in his attempt to justify this claim. And Reuss (to give one example of his method) says that St. John cannot have used \"the last day\" in the ordinary sense, \"because mystical theology has nothing to do with such a notion.[66]\" He means, I suppose, that the mystic, who likes to speak of heaven as a state, and of eternal life as a present possession, has no business to talk about future judgment. I cannot help thinking that this is a very grave mistake. There is no doubt that those who believe space and time to be only forms of our thought, must regard the traditional eschatology as symbolical. We are not concerned to maintain that there will be, literally, a great assize, holden at a date and place which could be announced if we knew it. If that is all that Reuss means, perhaps he is right in saying that \"mystical theology has nothing to do with such a notion.\" But if he means that such expressions as those referred to in St. John, about eternal life as something here and now, imply that judgment is now, and therefore not in the future, he is attributing to the evangelist, and to the whole array of religious thinkers who have used similar expressions, a view which is easy enough to understand, but which is destitute of any value, for it entirely fails to satisfy the religious consciousness. The feeling of the contrast between what ought to be and what is, is one of the deepest springs of faith in the unseen. It can only be ignored by shutting our eyes to half the facts of life. It is easy to say with Browning, \"God\\'s in His heaven: all\\'s right with the world,\" or with Emerson, that justice is not deferred, and that everyone gets exactly his deserts in this life; but it would require a robust confidence or a hard heart to maintain these propositions while standing among the ruins of an Armenian village, or by the deathbed of innocence betrayed. There is no doubt a sense in which it may be said that the ideal is the actual; but only when we have risen in thought to a region above the antitheses of past, present, and future, where \"is\" denotes, not the moment which passes as we speak, but the everlasting Now in the mind of God. This is not a region in which human thought can live; and the symbolical eschatology of religion supplies us with forms in which it is possible to think. The basis of the belief in future judgment is that deep conviction of the rationality of the world-order, or, in religious language, of the wisdom and justice of God, which we cannot and will not surrender. It is authenticated by an instinctive assurance which is strongest in the strongest minds, and which has nothing to do with any desire for spurious \"consolations\";[67] it is a conviction, not merely a hope, and we have every reason to believe that it is part of the Divine element in our nature. This conviction, like other mystical intuitions, is formless: the forms or symbols under which we represent it are the best that we can get. They are, as Plato says, \"a raft\" on which we may navigate strange seas of thought far out of our depth. We may use them freely, as if they were literally true, only remembering their symbolical character when they bring us into conflict with natural science, or when they tempt us to regard the world of experience as something undivine or unreal.',\n",
       " 'St. Juan of the Cross, the fellow-workman of St. Teresa in the reform of monasteries, is a still more perfect example of the Spanish type of Mysticism. His fame has never been so great as hers; for while Teresa\\'s character remained human and lovable in the midst of all her austerities, Juan carried self-abnegation to a fanatical extreme, and presents the life of holiness in a grim and repellent aspect. In his disdain of all compromise between the claims of God and the world, he welcomes every kind of suffering, and bids us choose always that which is most painful, difficult, and humiliating. His own life was divided between terrible mortifications and strenuous labour in the foundation of monasteries. Though his books show a tendency to Quietism, his character was one of fiery energy and unresting industry. Houses of \"discalced\" Carmelites sprang up all over Spain as the result of his labours. These monks and nuns slept upon bare boards, fasted eight months in the year, never ate meat, and wore the same serge dress in winter and summer. In some of these new foundations the Brethren even vied with each other in adding voluntary austerities to this severe rule. It was all part of the campaign against Protestantism. The worldliness and luxury of the Renaissance period were to be atoned for by a return to the purity and devotion of earlier centuries. The older Catholic ideal--the mediæval type of Christianity--was to be restored in all its completeness in the seventeenth century. This essentially militant character of the movement among the Carmelites must not be lost sight of: the two great Spanish mystics were before all things champions of the counter-Reformation.',\n",
       " 'St. Juan\\'s ideal of saintliness was as much of an anachronism as his scheme of Church reform. But no one ever climbed the rugged peaks of Mount Carmel with more heroic courage and patience. His life shows what tremendous moral force is generated by complete self-surrender to God. And happily neither his failure to read the signs of the times, nor his one-sided and defective grasp of Christian truth, could deprive him of the reward of his life of sacrifice--the reward, I mean, of feeling his fellowship with Christ in suffering. He sold \"all that he had\" to gain the pearl of great price, and the surrender was not made in vain.',\n",
       " 'St. Paul states in the clearest manner that Christ appeared to him, and that this revelation was the foundation of his Christianity and apostolic commission. \"Neither did I receive the Gospel from man,[71]\" he says, \"nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.\" It appears that he did not at first[72] think it necessary to \"confer with flesh and blood\"--to collect evidence about our Lord\\'s ministry, His death and resurrection; he had \"seen\" and felt Him, and that was enough. \"It was the good pleasure of God to reveal His Son in me,[73]\" he says simply, using the favourite mystical phraseology. The study of \"evidences,\" in the usual sense of the term in apologetics, he rejects with distrust and contempt.[74] External revelation cannot make a man religious. It can put nothing new into him. If there is nothing answering to it in his mind, it will profit him nothing. Nor can philosophy make a man religious. \"Man\\'s wisdom,\" \"the wisdom of the world,\" is of no avail to find spiritual truth. \"God chose the foolish things of the world, to put to shame them that are wise.\" \"The word of the Cross is, to them that are perishing, foolishness.\" By this language he, of course, does not mean that Christianity is irrational, and therefore to be believed on authority. That would be to lay its foundation upon external evidences, and nothing could be further from the whole bent of his teaching. What he does mean, and say very clearly, is that the carnal mind is disqualified from understanding Divine truths; \"it cannot know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\" He who has not raised himself above \"the world,\" that is, the interests and ideals of human society as it organises itself apart from God, and above \"the flesh,\" that is, the things which seem desirable to the \"average sensual man,\" does not possess in himself that element which can be assimilated by Divine grace. The \"mystery\" of the wisdom of God is necessarily hidden from him. St. Paul uses the word \"mystery\" in very much the same sense which St. Chrysostom[75] gives to it in the following careful definition: \"A mystery is that which is everywhere proclaimed, but which is not understood by those who have not right judgment. It is revealed, not by cleverness, but by the Holy Ghost, as we are able to receive it. And so we may call a mystery a secret ([Greek: aporrêton]), for even to the faithful it is not committed in all its fulness and clearness.\" In St. Paul the word is nearly always found in connexion with words denoting revelation or publication[76]. The preacher of the Gospel is a hierophant, but the Christian mysteries are freely communicated to all who can receive them. For many ages these truths were \"hid in God,[77]\" but now all men may be \"illuminated,[78]\" if they will fulfil the necessary conditions of initiation. These are to \"cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit,[79]\" and to have love, without which all else will be unavailing. But there are degrees of initiation. \"We speak wisdom among the perfect,\" he says (the [Greek: teleioi] are the fully initiated); but the carnal must still be fed with milk. Growth in knowledge, growth in grace, and growth in love, are so frequently mentioned together, that we must understand the apostle to mean that they are almost inseparable. But this knowledge, grace, and love is itself the work of the indwelling God, who is thus in a sense the organ as well as the object of the spiritual life. \"The Spirit searcheth all things,\" he says, \"yea, the deep things of God.\" The man who has the Spirit dwelling in him \"has the mind of Christ.\" \"He that is spiritual judgeth all things,\" and is himself \"judged of no man.\" It is, we must admit frankly, a dangerous claim, and one which may easily be subversive of all discipline. \"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty\"; but such liberty may become a cloak of maliciousness. The fact is that St. Paul had himself trusted in \"the Law,\" and it had led him into grievous error. As usually happens in such cases, his recoil from it was almost violent. He exalts the inner light into an absolute criterion of right and wrong, that no corner of the moral life may remain in bondage to Pharisaism. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and the stoning of Stephen were a crushing condemnation of legal and ceremonial righteousness; the law written in the heart of man, or rather spoken there by the living voice of the Holy Spirit, could never so mislead men as to make them think that they were doing God service by condemning and killing the just. Such memories might well lead St. Paul to use language capable of giving encouragement even to fanatical Anabaptists. But it is significant that the boldest claims on behalf of liberty all occur in the earlier Epistles.',\n",
       " 'St. Paul\\'s conception of Christ as the Life as well as the Light of the world has two consequences besides those which have been already mentioned. In the first place, it is fatal to religious individualism. The close unity which joins us to Christ is not so much a unity of the individual soul with the heavenly Christ, as an organic unity of all men, or, since many refuse their privileges, of all Christians, with their Lord. \"We, being many, are one body in Christ, and severally members one of another.[98]\" There must be \"no schism in the body,[99]\" but each member must perform its allotted function. St. Augustine is thoroughly in agreement with St. Paul when he speaks of Christ and the Church as \"unus Christus.\" Not that Christ is \"divided,\" so that He cannot be fully present to any individual--that is an error which St. Paul, St. Augustine, and the later mystics all condemn; but as the individual cannot reach his real personality as an isolated unit, he cannot, as an isolated unit, attain to full communion with Christ.',\n",
       " 'Still closer is the approximation to later speculation which we find in Philo, who was a contemporary of St. Paul. Philo and his Therapeutæ were genuine mystics of the monastic type. Many of them, however, had not been monks all their life, but were retired men of business, who wished to spend their old age in contemplation, as many still do in India. They were, of course, not Christians, but Hellenised Jews, though Eusebius, Jerome, and the Middle Ages generally thought that they were Christians, and were well pleased to find monks in the first century.[112]',\n",
       " 'Such faith, hope, and love were suffered to cast gleams of light upon the saint\\'s gloomy and thorn-strewn path. But nevertheless the text of which we are most often reminded in reading his pages is the verse of Amos: \"Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?\" It is a terrible view of life and duty--that we are to denude ourselves of everything that makes us citizens of the world--that nothing which is natural is capable of entering into relations with God--that all which is human must die, and have its place taken by supernatural infusion. St. Juan follows to the end the \"negative road\" of Dionysius, without troubling himself at all with the transcendental metaphysics of Neoplatonism. His nihilism or acosmism is not the result of abstracting from the notion of Being or of unity; its basis is psychological. It is \"subjective\" religion carried almost to its logical conclusion. The Neoplatonists were led on by the hope of finding a reconciliation between philosophy and positive religion; but no such problems ever presented themselves to the Spaniards. We hear nothing of the relation of the creation to God, or why the contemplation of it should only hinder instead of helping us to know its Maker. The world simply does not exist for St. Juan; nothing exists save God and human souls. The great human society has no interest for him; he would have us cut ourselves completely adrift from the aims and aspirations of civilised humanity, and, \"since nothing but the Infinite can satisfy us,\" to accept nothing until our nothingness is filled with the Infinite. He does not escape from the quietistic attitude of passive expectancy which belongs to this view of life; and it is only by a glaring inconsistency that he attaches any value to the ecclesiastical symbolism, which rests on a very different basis from that of his teaching. But St. Juan\\'s Mysticism brought him no intellectual emancipation, either for good or evil. Faith with him was the antithesis, not to sight, as in the Bible, but to reason. The sacrifice of reason was part of the crucifixion of the old man. And so he remained in an attitude of complete subservience to Church tradition and authority, and even to his \"director,\" an intermediary who is constantly mentioned by these post-Reformation mystics. Even this unqualified submissiveness did not preserve him from persecution during his lifetime, and suspicion afterwards. His books were only authorised twenty-seven years after his death, which occurred in 1591; and his beatification was delayed till 1674. His orthodoxy was defended largely by references to St. Teresa, who had already been canonised. But it could not be denied that the quietists of the next century might find much support for their controverted doctrines in both writers.',\n",

The whole movement was doomed to failure, inasmuch as scholasticism was philosophy in chains, and the negative road was Mysticism blindfolded. No fruitful reconciliation between philosophy and piety could be thus achieved. The decay of scholasticism put an end to these attempts at compromise. Henceforward the mystics either discard metaphysics, and develop their theology on the devotional and ascetic side--the course which was followed by the later Catholic mystics; or they copy Erigena in his independent attitude towards tradition.',\n",
       " 'Suso\\'s loving nature, like Augustine\\'s, needed an object of affection. His imagination concentrated itself upon the eternal Wisdom, personified in the Book of Proverbs in female form as a loving mistress, and the thought came often to him, \"Truly thou shouldest make trial of thy fortune, whether this high mistress, of whom thou hast heard so much, will become thy love; for in truth thy wild young heart will not remain without a love.\" Then in a vision he saw her, radiant in form, rich in wisdom, and overflowing with love; it is she who touches the summit of the heavens, and the depths of the abyss, who spreads herself from end to end, mightily and sweetly disposing all things.

There is also a perceptible change in the stress laid upon certain parts of the system, which brings Tauler nearer than Eckhart to the divines of the Reformation. In particular, his sense of sin is too deep for him to be satisfied with the Neoplatonic doctrine of its negativity, which led Eckhart into difficulties.[267]',\n",

The fruit of this knowledge is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.... By the Platonists\\' leave, this life and knowledge (that of the \\'contemplative man\\') peculiarly belongs to the true and sober Christian.

Those who are interested in Mysticism should certainly study the pathological symptoms which counterfeit mystical states, and from this point of view the essay in Degeneration is valuable. The observations of Nordau and other alienists must lead us to suspect very strongly the following kinds of symbolical representation, whether the symbols are borrowed from the external world, or created by the imagination:--(a) All those which include images of a sexual character. It is unnecessary to illustrate this. The visions of monks and nuns are often, as we might expect, unconsciously tinged with a morbid element of this kind. (b) Those which depend on mere verbal resemblances or other fortuitous correspondences. Nordau shows that the diseased brain is very ready to follow these false trains of association.

For we cannot but feel that there are deeper truths in this wonderful Gospel than have yet become part of the religious consciousness of mankind. Perhaps, as Origen says, no one can fully understand it who has not, like its author, lain upon the breast of Jesus.

The \"public Mysteries,\" of which the festival at Eleusis was the most important, were so called because the State admitted strangers by initiation to what was originally a national cult. (There were also private Mysteries, conducted for profit by itinerant priests [Greek: agyrtai] from the East, who as a class bore no good reputation.) The main features of the ritual at Eleusis are known. The festival began at Athens, where the mystæ collected, and, after a fast of several days, were \"driven\" to the sea, or to two salt lakes on the road to Eleusis, for a purifying bath. This kind of baptism washed away the stains of their former sins, the worst of which they were obliged to confess before being admitted to the Mysteries. Then, after sacrifices had been offered, the company went in procession to Eleusis, where Mystery-plays were performed in a great hall, large enough to hold thousands of people, and the votaries were allowed to handle certain sacred relics. A sacramental meal, in which a mixture of mint, barley-meal, and water was administered to the initiated, was an integral part of the festival. The most secret part of the ceremonies was reserved for the [Greek: epoptai] who had passed through the ordinary initiation in a previous year. It probably culminated in the solemn exhibition of a corn-ear, the symbol of Demeter. The obligation of silence was imposed not so much because there were any secrets to reveal, but that the holiest sacraments of the Greek religion might not be profaned by being brought into contact with common life. This feeling was strengthened by the belief that words are more than conventional symbols of things. A sacred formula must not be taken in vain, or divulged to persons who might misuse it.',\n",
       " 'The Holy Ghost is the \"bond\" (copula) of the Trinity, joining in perfect love the Father and the Son. Victorinus is the first to use this idea, which afterwards became common. It is based on the Neoplatonic triad of status, progressio, regressus ([Greek: monê, proodos, epistrophê]). In another place he symbolises the Holy Ghost as the female principle, the \"Mother of Christ\" in His eternal life. This metaphor is a relic of Gnosticism, which the Church wisely rejected.',\n",
       " 'The Imitation of Christ has been so often spoken of as the finest flower of Christian Mysticism, that it is impossible to omit all reference to it in these Lectures. And yet it is not, properly speaking, a mystical treatise. It is the ripe fruit of mediæval Christianity as concentrated in the life of the cloister, the last and best legacy, in this kind, of a system which was already decaying; but we find in it hardly a trace of that independence which made Eckhart a pioneer of modern philosophy, and the fourteenth century mystics forerunners of the Reformation. Thomas à Kempis preaches a Christianity of the heart; but he does not exhibit the distinguishing characteristics of Mysticism. The title by which the book is known is really the title of the first section only, and it does not quite accurately describe the contents of the book. Throughout the treatise we feel that we are reading a defence of the recluse and his scheme of life. Self-denial, renunciation of the world, prayer and meditation, utter humility and purity, are the road to a higher joy, a deeper peace, than anything which the world can give us. There are many sentences which remind us of the Roman Stoics, whose main object was by detachment from the world to render themselves invulnerable. Not that Thomas à Kempis shrinks from bearing the Cross. The Cross of Christ is always before him, and herein he is superior to those mystics who speak only of the Incarnation. But the monk of the fifteenth century was perhaps more thrown back upon himself than his predecessors in the fourteenth. The monasteries were no longer such homes of learning and centres of activity as they had been. It was no longer evident that the religious orders were a benefit to civilisation. That indifference to human interests, which we feel to be a weak spot in mediæval thought generally, and in the Neoplatonists to whom mediæval thought was so much indebted, reaches its climax in Thomas à Kempis. Not only does he distrust and disparage all philosophy, from Plato to Thomas Aquinas, but he shuns society and conversation as occasions of sin, and quotes with approval the pitiful epigram of Seneca, \"Whenever I have gone among men, I have returned home less of a man.\" It is, after all, the life of the \"shell-fish,\" as Plato calls it, which he considers the best. The book cannot safely be taken as a guide to the Christian life as a whole. What we do find in it, set forth with incomparable beauty and unstudied dignity, are the Christian graces of humility, simplicity, and purity of heart.',\n",

When we say it does not exist, we mean that we shall not always see it in this form. The \"Ideas\" are the ultimate form in which things are regarded by Intelligence, or by God. [Greek: Nous] is described as at once [Greek: stasis] and [Greek: kinêsis], that is, it is unchanging itself, but the whole cosmic process, which is ever in flux, is eternally present to it as a process.',\n",
       " 'The Logos dwells with God as His Wisdom (or sometimes he calls Wisdom, figuratively, the mother of the Logos). He is the \"second God,\" the \"Idea of Ideas\"; the other Ideas or Powers are the forces which he controls--\"the Angels,\" as he adds, suddenly remembering his Judaism. The Logos is also the mind of God expressing itself in act: the Ideas, therefore, are the content of the mind of God. Here he anticipates Plotinus; but he does not reduce God to a logical point. His God is self-conscious, and reasons. By the agency of the Logos the worlds were made: the intelligible world, the [Greek: kosmos noêtos], is the Logos acting as Creator. Indeed, Philo calls the intelligible universe \"the only and beloved Son of God\"; just as Erigena says, \"Be assured that the Word is the Nature of all things.\" The Son represents the world before God as High Priest, Intercessor, and Paraclete. He is the \"divine Angel\" that guides us; He is the \"bread of God,\" the \"dew of the soul,\" the \"convincer of sin\": no evil can touch the soul in which He dwells: He is the eternal image of the Father, and we, who are not yet fit to be called sons of God, may call ourselves His sons.',\n",
       " 'The Platonists thus lay great stress on the inner light, and identify it with the purified reason. The best exposition of their teaching on this head is in Smith\\'s beautiful sermon on \"The True Way or Method of attaining to Divine Knowledge.\" \"Divinity,\" he says, \"is a Divine life rather than a Divine science, to be understood rather by a spiritual sensation than by any verbal description. A good life is the prolepsis of Divine science--the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Divinity is a true efflux from the eternal light, which, like the sunbeams, does not only enlighten, but also heat and enliven; and therefore our Saviour hath in His beatitudes connext purity of heart to the beatific vision.\" \"Systems and models furnish but a poor wan light,\" compared with that which shines in purified souls. \"To seek our divinity merely in books and writings is to seek the living among the dead\"; in these, \"truth is often not so much enshrined as entombed.\" \"That which enables us to know and understand aright the things of God, must be a living principle of holiness within us. The sun of truth never shines into any unpurged souls.... Such as men themselves are, such will God Himself seem to be.... Some men have too bad hearts to have good heads.... He that will find truth must seek it with a free judgment and a sanctified mind.\"',\n",

From this degradation the mystics of the cloister were happily free; but a morbid element is painfully prominent in the records of many mediæval saints, whose experiences are classified by Ribet. He enumerates--(1) \"Divine touches,\" which Scaramelli defines as \"real but purely spiritual sensations, by which the soul feels the intimate presence of God, and tastes Him with great delight\"; (2) \"The wound of love,\" of which one of his authorities says, \"hæc poena tam suavis est quod nulla sit in hac vita delectatio quæ magis satisfaciat.\" It is to this experience that Cant. ii. 5 refers: \"Fulcite me floribus, stipate me malis, quia amore langueo.\" Sometimes the wound is not purely spiritual: St. Teresa, as was shown by a post-mortem examination, had undergone a miraculous \"transverberation of the heart\": \"et pourtant elle survécut près de vingt ans à cette blessure mortelle\"! (3) Catherine of Siena was betrothed to Christ with a ring, which remained always on her fingers, though visible to herself alone. Lastly, in the revelations of St. Gertrude we read: \"Feria tertia Paschæ dum communicatura desideraret a Domino ut per idem sacramentum vivificum renovare dignaretur in anima eius matrimonium spirituale quod ipsi in spiritu erat desponsata per fidem et religionem, necnon per virginalis pudicitiæ integritatem, Dominus blanda serenitate respondit: hoc, inquiens, indubitanter faciam.

       " 'The Trinitarian doctrine of Victorinus anticipates in a remarkable manner that of the later philosophical mystics. The Father, he says, eternally knows Himself in the Son. The Son is the self-objectification of God, the \"forma\" of God[189], the utterance of the Absolute. The Father is \"cessatio,\" \"silentium,\" \"quies\"; but He is also \"motus\" while the Son is \"motio.\" There is no contradiction between \"motus\" and \"cessatio\" since \"motus\" is not the same as \"mutatio.\" \"Movement\" belongs to the \"being\" of God; and this eternal \"movement\" is the generation of the Son. This eternal generation is exalted above time. All life is now: we live always in the present, not in the past or future; and thus our life is a symbol of eternity, to which all things are for ever present[190]. The generation of the Son is at the same time the creation of the archetypal world; for the Son is the cosmic principle[191], through whom all that potentially is is actualised. He even says that the Father is to the Son as [Greek: ho mê ôn] to [Greek: ho ôn], thus taking the step which Plotinus wished to avoid, and applying the same expression to the superessential God as to infra-essential matter.[192]',\n",
       " 'The Unity of all existence is a fundamental doctrine of Mysticism. God is in all, and all is in God. \"His centre is everywhere, and His circumference nowhere,\" as St. Bonaventura puts it. It is often argued that this doctrine leads direct to Pantheism, and that speculative Mysticism is always and necessarily pantheistic. This is, of course, a question of primary importance. It is in the hope of dealing with it adequately that I have selected three writers who have been frequently called pantheists, for discussion in these Lectures. I mean Dionysius the Areopagite, Scotus Erigena, and Eckhart. But it would be impossible even to indicate my line of argument in the few minutes left me this morning.',\n",
       " 'The aim of Eckhart\\'s religious philosophy is to find a speculative basis for the doctrines of the Church, which shall at the same time satisfy the claims of spiritual religion. His aims are purely constructive, and he shows a distaste for polemical controversy. The writers whom he chiefly cites by name are Dionysius, Augustine, Gregory, and Boethius; but he must have read Erigena, and probably Averroes, writers to whom a Catholic could hardly confess his obligations.[235] He also frequently introduces quotations with the words, \"A master saith.\" The \"master\" is nearly always Thomas Aquinas, to whom Eckhart was no doubt greatly indebted, though it would be a great mistake to say, as some have done, that all Eckhart can be found in the Summa. For instance, he sets himself in opposition to Thomas about the \"spark,\" which Thomas regarded as a faculty of the soul, while Eckhart, in his later writings, says that it is uncreated.[236] His double object leads him into some inconsistencies. Intellectually, he is drawn towards a semi-pantheistic idealism; his heart makes him an Evangelical Christian. But though it is possible to find contradictions in his writings, his transparent intellectual honesty and his great powers of thought, combined with deep devoutness and childlike purity of soul, make him one of the most interesting figures in the history of Christian philosophy.',\n",
       " 'The best mystics rightly see in the doctrine of the Divinity of Christ the best safeguard against the extravagances to which the notion of deification easily leads. Particularly instructive here are the warnings which are repeated again and again in the Theologia Germanica. \"The false light dreameth itself to be God, and taketh to itself what belongeth to God as God is in eternity without the creature. Now, God in eternity is without contradiction, suffering, and grief, and nothing can hurt or vex Him. But with God when He is made man it is otherwise.\" \"Therefore the false light thinketh and declareth itself to be above all works, words, customs, laws, and order, and above that life which Christ led in the body which He possessed in His holy human nature. So likewise it professeth to remain unmoved by any of the creature\\'s works; whether they be good or evil, against God or not, is all alike to it; and it keepeth itself apart from all things, like God in eternity; and all that belongeth to God and to no creature it taketh to itself, and vainly dreameth that this belongeth to it.\" \"It doth not set up to be Christ, but the eternal God. And this is because Christ\\'s life is distasteful and burdensome to nature, therefore it will have nothing to do with it; but to be God in eternity and not man, or to be Christ as He was after His resurrection, is all easy and pleasant and comfortable to nature, and so it holdeth it to be best.\"',\n",
       " 'The charge of \"pantheistic tendency\" will not, I hope, be brought against me without due consideration. I have tried to show how the Johannine Logos-doctrine, which is the basis of Christian Mysticism, differs from Asiatic Pantheism, from Acosmism, and from (one kind of) evolutionary Idealism. Of course, speculative Mysticism is nearer to Pantheism than to Deism; but I think it is possible heartily to eschew Deism without falling into the opposite error.',\n",

Happiness after death was the great promise held out in the Mysteries. The initiated were secure of blessedness in the next world, while the uninitiated must expect \"to lie in darkness and mire after their death\" (cf. Plato, Phædrus, 69).',\n",

Beauty is the chief mediator between the good and the true;[403] and this is why the great poets have been also prophets. But Science at present lags behind; she has not found her God; and to this is largely due the \"unrest of the age.\" Much has already been done in the right direction by divines, philosophers, and physicists, and more still, perhaps, by the great poets, who have striven earnestly to see the spiritual background which lies behind the abstractions of materialistic science.

The success of the imposture is amazing, even in that uncritical age, and gives much food for reflection. The sixth century saw nothing impossible in a book full of the later Neoplatonic theories--those of Proclus rather than Plotinus[158]--having been written in the first century.

He borrows an illustration, not a very happy one, from Plotinus. \"As iron, when it becomes red-hot, seems to be turned into pure fire, but remains no less iron than before; so when body passes into soul, and rational substances into God, they do not lose their identity, but preserve it in a higher state of being.\"',\n",

In spirit, because thy spirit is that alone in thee which can unite and cleave unto God, and receive the working of the Divine Spirit upon thee. In truth, because this adoration in spirit is that truth and reality of which all outward forms and rites, though instituted by God, are only the figure for a time; but this worship is eternal. Accustom thyself to the holy service of this inward temple. In the midst of it is the fountain of living water, of which thou mayst drink and live for ever. There the mysteries of thy redemption are celebrated, or rather opened in life and power. There the supper of the Lamb is kept; the bread that came down from heaven, that giveth life to the world, is thy true nourishment: all is done, and known in real experience, in a living sensibility of the work of God on the soul. There the birth, the life, the sufferings, the death, the resurrection and ascension of Christ, are not merely remembered, but inwardly found and enjoyed as the real states of thy soul, which has followed Christ in the regeneration. When once thou art well grounded in this inward worship, thou wilt have learnt to live unto God above time and place.

Tauler also bids us \"put out into the deep, and let down our nets\"; but his \"deep\" is in the heart, not in the intellect. \"My children, you should not ask about these great high problems,\" he says; and he prefers not to talk much about them, \"for no teacher can teach what he has not lived through himself.\" Still he speaks, like Dionysius and Eckhart, of the \"Divine darkness,\" \"the nameless, formless nothing,\" \"the wild waste,\" and so forth; and says of God that He is \"the Unity in which all multiplicity is transcended,\" and that in Him are gathered up both becoming and being, eternal rest and eternal motion.

For what could begin to deny self, if there were not something in man different from self?... The Word of God is the hidden treasure of every human soul, immured under flesh and blood, till as a day-star it arises in our hearts, and changes the son of an earthly Adam into a son of God.\" Is not this the Platonic doctrine of anamnesis, Christianised in a most beautiful manner?',\n",

       " 'The early part of the sixteenth century was a period of high culture in Spain. The universities of Salamanca and Alcala were famous throughout Europe; the former is said (doubtless with great exaggeration) to have contained at one time fourteen thousand students. But the Inquisition, which had been founded to suppress Jews and Mahometans, was roused to a more baneful activity by the appearance of Protestantism in Spain. Before the end of the sixteenth century, the Spanish people, who up to that time had been second to none in love of liberty and many-sided energy, had been changed into sombre fanatics, sunk in ignorance and superstition, and retaining hardly a trace of their former buoyancy and healthy independence.[286] The first Index Expurgatorius was published in 1546; the burning of Protestants began in 1559. Till then, Eckhart, Tauler, Suso, and Ruysbroek had circulated freely in Spain. But the Inquisition condemned them all, except Ruysbroek. The same rigour was extended to the Arabian philosophers, and so their speculations influenced Spanish theology much less than might have been expected from the long sojourn of the Moors in the Peninsula. Averroism was known in Spain chiefly through the medium of the Fons Vitæ of Ibn Gebirol (Avicebron). Dionysius and the scholastic mystics of the Middle Ages were, of course, allowed to be read. But besides these, the works of Plato and Plotinus were accessible in Latin translations, and were highly valued by some of the Spanish mystics. This statement may surprise those who have identified Spanish Mysticism with Teresa and Juan of the Cross, and who know how little Platonism is to be found in their theology. But these two militant champions of the counter-Reformation numbered among their contemporaries mystics of a different type, whose writings, little known in this country, entitle them to an honourable place in the roll of Christian Platonists.',\n",
       " 'The employment of erotic imagery to express the individual relation between Christ and the soul is always dangerous; but this objection does not apply to the statement that \"the Church is the bride of Christ.\" Even in the Old Testament we find the chosen people so spoken of (cf. Isa. liv. 5; Jer. iii. 14). Professor Cheyne thinks that the Canticles were interpreted in this sense, and that this is why the book gained admission into the Canon. In the New Testament, St. Paul uses the symbol of marriage in Rom. vii. 1-4; 1 Cor. xi. 3; Eph. v. 23-33. On the last passage Canon Gore says: \"The love of Christ--the removal of obstacles to His love by atoning sacrifice--the act of spiritual purification--the gradual sanctification--the consummated union in glory; these are the moments of the Divine process of redemption, viewed from the side of Christ, which St. Paul specifies.\" This use of the \"sacrament\" of marriage (as a symbol of the mystical union between Christ and the Church), which alone has the sanction of the New Testament, is one which, we hope, the Church will always treasure. The more personal relation also exists, and the fervent devotion which it elicits must not be condemned; though we are forced to remember that in our mysteriously constituted minds the highest and lowest emotions lie very near together, and that those who have chosen a life of detachment from earthly ties must be especially on their guard against the \"occasional revenges\" which the lower nature, when thwarted, is always plotting against the higher.',\n",

Whenever we find such language as that quoted from Ruysbroek, about \"rising above all distinctions,\" we may be sure that this error has been committed. Mystics of all times would have done well to keep in their minds a very happy phrase which Irenæus quotes from some unknown author, \"He spoke well who said that the infinite (immensum) Father is measured (mensuratum) in the Son: mensura enim Patris Filius.[276]\" It is to this \"measure,\" not to the immeasureable, that we are bidden to aspire.',\n",
       " 'The essence of sin is self-assertion or self-will, and consequent separation from God. Tauler has, perhaps, a deeper sense of sin than any of his predecessors, and he revives the Augustinian (anti-Pelagian) teaching on the miserable state of fallen humanity. Sensuality and pride, the two chief manifestations of self-will, have invaded the whole of our nature. Pride is a sin of the spirit, and the poison has invaded \"even the ground\"--the \"created ground,\" that is, as the unity of all the faculties. It will be remembered that the Neoplatonic doctrine was that the spiritual part of our nature can take no defilement. Tauler seems to believe that under one aspect the \"created ground\" is the transparent medium of the Divine light, but in this sense it is only potentially the light of our whole body. He will not allow the sinless apex mentis to be identified with the personality. Separation from God is the source of all misery. Therein lies the pain of hell. The human soul can never cease to yearn and thirst after God; \"and the greatest pain\" of the lost \"is that this longing can never be satisfied.\" In the German Theology, the necessity of rising above the \"I\" and \"mine\" is treated as the great saving truth. \"When the creature claimeth for its own anything good, it goeth astray.\" \"The more of self and me, the more of sin and wickedness. Be simply and wholly bereft of self.\" \"So long as a man seeketh his own highest good because it is his, he will never find it. For so long as he doeth this, he seeketh himself, and deemeth that he himself is the highest good.\" (These last sentences are almost verbally repeated in a sermon by John Smith, the Cambridge Platonist.)',\n",

The ceremonies may have been trivial, and even at times ludicrous; but the discovery had been made that the performance of solemn acts of devotion in common, after ascetical preparation, and with the aid of an impressive ritual, is one of the strongest incentives to piety. Diodorus is not alone in saying (he is speaking of the Samothracian Mysteries) that \"those who have taken part in them are said to become more pious, more upright, and in every way better than their former selves.\"',\n",
       " 'The first is a contempt for the historical framework of Christianity. We have already seen how strongly St. John warns us against this perversion of spiritual religion. But those numerous sects and individual thinkers who have disregarded this warning, have often appealed to the authority of St. Paul, who in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians says, \"Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now we know Him so no more.\" Here, they say, is a distinct admission that the worship of the historical Christ, \"the man Christ Jesus,\" is a stage to be passed through and then left behind. There is just this substratum of truth in a very mischievous error, that St. Paul does tell us[100] that he began to teach the Corinthians by giving them in the simplest possible form the story of \"Jesus Christ and Him crucified.\" The \"mysteries\" of the faith, the \"wisdom\" which only the \"perfect\" can understand, were deferred till the converts had learned their first lessons. But if we look at the passage in question, which has shocked and perplexed many good Christians, we shall find that St. Paul is not drawing a contrast between the earthly and the heavenly Christ, bidding us worship the Second Person of the Trinity, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, and to cease to contemplate the Cross on Calvary. He is distinguishing rather between the sensuous presentation of the facts of Christ\\'s life, and a deeper realisation of their import. It should be our aim to \"know no man after the flesh\"; that is to say, we should try to think of human beings as what they are, immortal spirits, sharers with us of a common life and a common hope, not as what they appear to our eyes. And the same principle applies to our thoughts about Christ. To know Christ after the flesh is to know Him, not as man, but as a man. St. Paul in this verse condemns all religious materialism, whether it take the form of hysterical meditation upon the physical details of the passion, or of an over-curious interest in the manner of the resurrection. There is no trace whatever in St. Paul of any aspiration to rise above Christ to the contemplation of the Absolute--to treat Him as only a step in the ladder. This is an error of false Mysticism; the true mystic follows St. Paul in choosing as his ultimate goal the fulness of Christ, and not the emptiness of the undifferentiated Godhead.',\n",
       " 'The first is that properly called Acosmism, which we have encountered as Orientalised Platonism. Plato\\'s theory of ideas was popularised into a doctrine of two separate worlds, related to each other as shadow and substance. The intelligible world, which is in the mind of God, alone exists; and thus, by denying reality to the visible world, we get a kind of idealistic Pantheism. But the notion of God as abstract Unity, which, as we have seen, was held by the later Neoplatonists and their Christian followers, seems to make a real world impossible; for bare Unity cannot create, and the metaphor of the sun shedding his rays explains nothing. Accordingly the \"intelligible world,\" the sphere of reality, drops out, and we are left with only the infra-real world and the supra-real One. So we are landed in nihilism or Asiatic Mysticism[186].',\n",

       " 'The first three Gospels are not written in the religious dialect of Mysticism. It is all the more important to notice that the fundamental doctrines on which the system (if we may call it a system) rests, are all found in them. The vision of God is promised in the Sermon on the Mount, and promised only to those who are pure in heart. The indwelling presence of Christ, or of the Holy Spirit, is taught in several places; for instance--\"The kingdom of God is within you\"; \"Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them\"; \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.\" The unity of Christ and His members is implied by the words, \"Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\" Lastly, the great law of the moral world,--the law of gain through loss, of life through death,--which is the corner-stone of mystical (and, many have said, of Christian) ethics, is found in the Synoptists as well as in St. John. \"Whosoever shall seek to gain his life (or soul) shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life (or soul) shall preserve it.\"',\n",
       " 'The following is perhaps the most instructive passage: \"There is in the soul something which is above the soul, Divine, simple, a pure nothing; rather nameless than named, rather unknown than known. Of this I am accustomed to speak in my discourses. Sometimes I have called it a power, sometimes an uncreated light, and sometimes a Divine spark. It is absolute and free from all names and all forms, just as God is free and absolute in Himself. It is higher than knowledge, higher than love, higher than grace. For in all these there is still distinction. In this power God doth blossom and flourish with all His Godhead, and the Spirit flourisheth in God. In this power the Father bringeth forth His only-begotten Son, as essentially as in Himself; and in this light ariseth the Holy Ghost. This spark rejecteth all creatures, and will have only God, simply as He is in Himself. It rests satisfied neither with the Father, nor with the Son, nor with the Holy Ghost, nor with the three Persons, so far as each existeth in its particular attribute. It is satisfied only with the superessential essence. It is determined to enter into the simple Ground, the still Waste, the Unity where no man dwelleth. Then it is satisfied in the light; then it is one: it is one in itself, as this Ground is a simple stillness, and in itself immovable; and yet by this immobility are all things moved.\"',\n",
       " \"The foregoing analysis of St. Paul's teaching has, I hope, justified the statement that all the essentials of Mysticism are to be found in his Epistles.

These two points it will be well to consider before leaving the subject.\",\n",

It was the object of his life to be a religious teacher, and I think there is no incongruity in placing him at the end of the roll of mystical divines who have been dealt with in these Lectures. His intellectual kinship with the acknowledged representatives of Nature-Mysticism will, I hope, appear very plainly.',\n",

And seldom has the Christian temper found a nobler expression than in the lives and writings of such men as Whichcote and John Smith.[358]',\n",

A species of dentaria, whose roots resemble teeth, is a cure for toothache and scurvy.\"--Vaughan, Hours with the Mystics, vol. ii. p. 77. It is said that some traces of this quaint superstition survive even in the modern materia medica. The alliance between medicine and Mysticism subsisted for a long time, and forms a curious chapter of history.]',\n",
       " 'The history of the word begins in close connexion with the Greek mysteries.[3] A mystic [Greek: mystês] is one who has been, or is being, initiated into some esoteric knowledge of Divine things, about which he must keep his mouth shut ([Greek: myein]); or, possibly, he is one whose eyes are still shut, one who is not yet an [Greek: epoptês].[4] The word was taken over, with other technical terms of the mysteries, by the Neoplatonists, who found in the existing mysteriosophy a discipline, worship, and rule of life congenial to their speculative views. But as the tendency towards quietism and introspection increased among them, another derivation for \"Mysticism\" was found--it was explained to mean deliberately shutting the eyes to all external things.[5] We shall see in the sequel how this later Neoplatonism passed almost entire into Christianity, and, while forming the basis of mediæval Mysticism, caused a false association to cling to the word even down to the Reformation.[6]',\n",
       " 'The history of this doctrine of the spark, and of the closely connected word synteresis, is interesting. The word \"spark\" occurs in this connexion as early as Tatian, who says (Or. 13): \"In the beginning the spirit was a constant companion of the soul, but forsook it because the soul would not follow it; yet it retained, as it were, a spark of its power,\" etc. See also Tertullian, De Anima, 41. The curious word synteresis (often misspelt sinderesis), which plays a considerable part in mediæval mystical treatises, occurs first in Jerome (on Ezech. i.): \"Quartamque ponunt quam Græci vocant [Greek: syntêrêsin], quæ scintilla conscientiæ in Cain quoque pectore non exstinguitur, et qua victi voluptatibus vel furore nos peccare sentimus.... In Scripturis [eam] interdum vocari legimus Spiritum.\" Cf. Rom. viii. 26; 2 Cor. ii. 11. Then we find it in Alexander of Hales, and in Bonaventura, who (Itinerare, c. I) defines it as \"apex mentis seu scintilla\"; and more precisely (Breviloquium, Pars 2, c. 11): \"Benignissimus Deus quadruplex contulit ei adiutorium, scilicet duplex naturæ et duplex gratiæ. Duplicem enim indidit rectitudinem ipsi naturæ, videlicet unam ad recte iudicandum, et hæc est rectitudo conscientiæ, aliam ad recte volendum, et hæc est synteresis, cuius est remurmurare contra malum et stimulare ad bonum.\" Hermann of Fritslar speaks of it as a power or faculty in the soul, wherein God works immediately, \"without means and without intermission.\" Ruysbroek defines it as the natural will towards good implanted in us all, but weakened by sin. Giseler says: \"This spark was created with the soul in all men, and is a clear light in them, and strives in every way against sin, and impels steadily to virtue, and presses ever back to the source from which it sprang.\" It has, says Lasson, a double meaning in mystical theology, (a) the ground of the soul; (b) the highest ethical faculty. In Thomas Aquinas it is distinguished from \"intellectus principiorum,\" the former being the highest activity of the moral sense, the latter of the intellect. In Gerson, \"synteresis\" is the highest of the affective faculties, the organ of which is the intelligence (an emanation from the highest intelligence, which is God Himself), and the activity of which is contemplation. Speaking generally, the earlier scholastic mystics regard it as a remnant of the sinless state before the fall, while for Eckhart and his school it is the core of the soul.',\n",
       " 'The idea of deification startles and shocks the modern reader. It astonishes us to find that these earnest and humble saints at times express themselves in language which surpasses the arrogance even of the Stoics. We feel that there must be something wrong with a system which ends in obliterating the distinction between the Creator and His creatures. We desire in vain to hear some echo of Job\\'s experience, so different in tone: \"I have heard Thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth Thee; therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\" The proper effect of the vision of God is surely that which Augustine describes in words already quoted: \"I tremble, and I burn. I tremble, in that I am unlike Him; I burn, in that I am like Him.\" Nor is this only the beginner\\'s experience: St. Paul had almost \"finished his course\" when he called himself the chief of sinners. The joy which uplifts the soul, when it feels the motions of the Holy Spirit, arises from the fact that in such moments \"the spirit\\'s true endowments stand out plainly from its false ones\"; we then see the \"countenance of our genesis,\" as St. James calls it--the man or woman that God meant us to be, and know that we could not so see it if we were wholly cut off from its realisation. But the clearer the vision of the ideal, the deeper must be our self-abasement when we turn our eyes to the actual. We must not escape from this sharp and humiliating contrast by mentally annihilating the self, so as to make it impossible to say, \"Look on this picture, and on this.\" Such false humility leads straight to its opposite--extreme arrogance. Moreover, to regard deification as an accomplished fact, involves, as I have said (p. 33), a contradiction. The process of unification with the Infinite must be a progressus ad infinitum. The pessimistic conclusion is escaped by remembering that the highest reality is supra-temporal, and that the destiny which God has designed for us has not merely a contingent realisation, but is in a sense already accomplished. There are, in fact, two ways in which we may abdicate our birthright, and surrender the prize of our high calling: we may count ourselves already to have apprehended, which must be a grievous delusion, or we may resign it as unattainable, which is also a delusion.',\n",
       " 'The idea of man as a microcosm was developed in two ways. Plotinus said that \"every man is double,\" meaning that one side of his soul is in contact with the intelligible, the other with the sensible world. He is careful to explain that the doctrine of Divine Immanence does not mean that God divides Himself among the many individuals, but that they partake of Him according to their degrees of receptivity, so that each one is potentially in possession of all the fulness of God. Proclus tries to explain how this can be. \"There are three sorts of Wholes--the first, anterior to the parts; the second, composed of the parts; the third, knitting into one stuff the parts and the whole.[54]\" In this third sense the whole resides in the parts, as well as the parts in the whole. St. Augustine states the same doctrine in clearer language.[55] It will be seen at once how this doctrine encourages that class of Mysticism which bids us \"sink into the depths of our own souls\" in order to find God.',\n",
       " 'The idea of mystical union by means of a common meal was, as we have seen, familiar to the Greeks. For instance, Plutarch says (Non fosse suav. vivi sec. Epic. 21), \"It is not the wine or the cookery that delights us at these feasts, but good hope, and the belief that God is present with us, and that He accepts our service graciously.\" There have always been two ideas of sacrifice, alike in savage and civilised cults--the mystical, in which it is a communion, the victim who is slain and eaten being himself the god, or a symbol of the god; and the commercial, in which something valuable is offered to the god in the hope of receiving some benefit in exchange. The Mysteries certainly encouraged the idea of communion, and made it easier for the Christian rite to gather up into itself all the religious elements which can be contained in a sacrament of this kind.',\n",
       " \"The idea of will as a world-principle--not in Schopenhauer's sense of a blind force impelling from within, but as the determination of a conscious Mind--lifts us at once out of Pantheism.[184] It sets up the distinction between what is and what ought to be, which Pantheism cannot find room for, and at the same time implies that the cosmic process is already complete in the consciousness of God, which cannot be held if He is subordinated to the category of time.\",\n",
       " 'The image of Jesus Christ, Fénelon continues, is not clearly seen by contemplatives at first, and may be withdrawn while the soul passes through the last furnace of trial; but we can never cease to need Him, \"though it is true that the most eminent saints are accustomed to regard Him less as an exterior object than as the interior principle of their lives.\" They are in error who speak of possessing God in His supreme simplicity, and of no more knowing Christ after the flesh. Contemplation is called passive because it excludes the interested activity of the soul, not because it excludes real action. (Here again Fénelon is rather explaining away than explaining his authorities.) The culmination of the \"passive state\" is \"transformation,\" in which love is the life of the soul, as it is its being and substance. \"Catherine of Genoa said, I find no more me; there is no longer any other I but God.\" \"But it is false to say that transformation is a deification of the real and natural soul, or a hypostatic union, or an unalterable conformity with God.[310]\" In the passive state we are still liable to mortal sin. (It is characteristic of Fénelon that he contradicts, without rejecting, the substitution-doctrine plainly stated in the sentence from Catherine of Genoa.)',\n",
       " 'The importance attached to the \"prayer of quiet\" can only be understood when we remember how much mechanical recitation of forms of prayer was enjoined by Romish \"directors.\" It is, of course, possible for the soul to commune with God without words, perhaps even without thoughts;[313] but the recorded prayers of our Blessed Lord will not allow us to regard these ecstatic states as better than vocal prayer, when the latter is offered \"with the spirit, and with the understanding also.\"',\n",
       " 'The indwelling of God in the soul is the real centre of Tauler\\'s doctrine, but his psychology is rather intricate and difficult. He speaks of three phases of personal life, the sensuous nature, the reason, and the \"third man\"--the spiritual life or pure substance of the soul. He speaks also of an \"uncreated ground,\" which is the abyss of the Godhead, but yet \"in us,\" and of a \"created ground,\" which he uses in a double sense, now of the empirical self, which is imperfect and must be purified, and now of the ideal man, as God intended him to be. This latter is \"the third man,\" and is also represented by the \"spark\" at the \"apex of the soul,\" which is to transform the rest of the soul into its own likeness. The \"uncreated ground,\" in Tauler, works upon us through the medium of the \"created ground,\" and not as in Eckhart, immediately. The \"created ground,\" in this sense, he calls \"the Image,\" which is identical with Eckhart\\'s \"spark.\" It is a creative principle as well as created, like the \"Ideas\" of Erigena.',\n",
       " 'The influence of Cabbalism at this period was felt not only in the growth of magic, but in the revival of the science of allegorism, which resembles magic in its doctrine of occult sympathies, though without the theurgic element. According to this view of nature, everything in the visible world has an emblematic meaning. Everything that a man saw, heard, or did--colours, numbers, birds, beasts, and flowers, the various actions of life--was to remind him of something else.[342] The world was supposed to be full of sacred cryptograms, and every part of the natural order testified in hieroglyphics[343] to the truths of Christianity. Thus the shamrock bears witness to the Trinity, the spider is an emblem of the devil, and so forth. This kind of symbolism was and is extensively used merely as a picture-language, in which there is no pretence that the signs are other than artificial or conventional. The language of signs may be used either to instruct those who cannot understand words, or to baffle those who can. Thus, a crucifix may be as good as a sermon to an illiterate peasant; while the sign of a fish was used by the early Christians because it was unintelligible to their enemies. This is not symbolism in the sense which I have given to the word in this Lecture.[344] But it is otherwise when the type is used as a proof of the antitype. This latter method had long been in use in biblical exegesis. Pious persons found a curious satisfaction in turning the most matter of fact statements into enigmatic prophecies. Every verse must have its \"mystical\" as well as its natural meaning, and the search for \"types\" was a recognised branch of apologetics. Allegorism became authoritative and dogmatic, which it has no right to be. It would be rash to say that this pseudo-science, which has proved so attractive to many minds, is entirely valueless. The very absurdity of the arguments used by its votaries should make us suspect that there is a dumb logic of a more respectable sort behind them. There is, underlying this love of types and emblems, a strong conviction that if \"one eternal purpose runs\" through the ages, it must be discernible in small things as well as in great. Everything in the world, if we could see things as they are, must be symbolic of the Divine Power which made it and maintains it in being. We cannot believe that anything in life is meaningless, or has no significance beyond the fleeting moment. Whatever method helps us to realise this is useful, and in a sense true. So far as this we may go with the allegorists, while at the same time we may be thankful that the cobwebs which they spun over the sacred texts have now been cleared away, so that we can at last read our Bible as its authors intended it to be read.[345]',\n",
       " 'The last great scholastic mystic is Gerson, who lived from 1363 to 1429. He attempts to reduce Mysticism to an exact science, tabulating and classifying all the teaching of his predecessors. A very brief summary of his system is here given.',\n",
       " 'The last stage of the journey, in which the soul presses towards the mark, and gains the prize of its high calling, is the unitive or contemplative life, in which man beholds God face to face, and is joined to Him. Complete union with God is the ideal limit of religion, the attainment of which would be at once its consummation and annihilation. It is in the continual but unending approximation to it that the life of religion subsists.[21] We must therefore beware of regarding the union as anything more than an infinite process, though, as its end is part of the eternal counsel of God, there is a sense in which it is already a fact, and not merely a thing desired. But the word deification holds a very large place in the writings of the Fathers, and not only among those who have been called mystics. We find it in Irenæus as well as in Clement, in Athanasius as well as in Gregory of Nyssa. St. Augustine is no more afraid of \"deificari\" in Latin than Origen of [Greek: theopoieisthai] in Greek. The subject is one of primary importance to anyone who wishes to understand mystical theology; but it is difficult for us to enter into the minds of the ancients who used these expressions, both because [Greek: theos] was a very fluid concept in the early centuries, and because our notions of personality are very different from those which were prevalent in antiquity. On this latter point I shall have more to say presently; but the evidence for the belief in \"deification,\" and its continuance through the Middle Ages, is too voluminous to be given in the body of these Lectures.[22] Let it suffice to say here that though such bold phrases as \"God became man, that we might become God,\" were commonplaces of doctrinal theology at least till after Augustine, even Clement and Origen protest strongly against the \"very impious\" heresy that man is \"a part of God,\" or \"consubstantial with God.[23]\" The attribute of Divinity which was chiefly in the minds of the Greek Fathers when they made these statements, was that of imperishableness.',\n",
       " 'The later Roman Catholic mystics, though they include some beautiful and lovable characters, do not develop any further the type which we have found in St. Teresa and St. Juan. St. Francis de Sales has been a favourite devotional writer with thousands in this country. He presents the Spanish Mysticism softened and polished into a graceful and winning pietism, such as might refine and elevate the lives of the \"honourable women\" who consulted him. The errors of the quietists certainly receive some countenance from parts of his writings, but they are neutralised by maxims of a different tendency, borrowed eclectically from other sources.[301]',\n",
       " 'The law of redemption, which St. Paul considers to have been triumphantly summed up by the death and resurrection of Christ,[86] would hardly be proved to be an universal law if the Pauline Christ were only the \"heavenly man,\" as some critics have asserted. St. Paul\\'s teaching about the Person of Christ was really almost identical with the Logos doctrine as we find it in St. John\\'s prologue, and as it was developed by the mystical philosophy of a later period. Not only is His pre-existence \"in the form of God\" clearly taught,[87] but He is the agent in the creation of the universe, the vital principle upholding and pervading all that exists. \"The Son,\" we read in the Epistle to the Colossians,[88] \"is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in Him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth; all things have been created through Him, and unto Him; and He is before all things, and in Him all things consist\" (that is, \"hold together,\" as the margin of the Revised Version explains it). \"All things are summed up in Christ,\" he says to the Ephesians.[89] \"Christ is all and in all,\" we read again in the Colossians.[90] And in that bold and difficult passage of the 15th chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians he speaks of the \"reign\" of Christ as coextensive with the world\\'s history. When time shall end, and all evil shall be subdued to good, Christ \"will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father,\" \"that God may be all in all.[91]\" Very important, too, is the verse in which he says that the Israelites in the wilderness \"drank of that spiritual rock which followed them, and that rock was Christ.[92]\" It reminds us of Clement\\'s language about the Son as the Light which broods over all history.',\n",
       " \"The life of St. Teresa[296] is more interesting than her teaching. She had all the best qualities of her noble Castilian ancestors-- simplicity, straightforwardness, and dauntless courage; and the record of her self-denying life is enlivened by numerous flashes of humour, which make her character more lovable. She is best known as a visionary, and it is mainly through her visions that she is often regarded as one of the most representative mystics. But these visions do not occupy a very large space in the story of her life. They were frequent during the first two or three years of her convent life, and again between the ages of forty and fifty: there was a long gap between the two periods, and during the last twenty years of her life, when she was actively engaged in founding and visiting religious houses, she saw them no more. This experience was that of many other saints of the cloister. Spiritual consolations seem to be frequently granted to encourage young beginners;[297] then they are withdrawn, and only recovered after a long period of dryness and darkness; but in later life, when the character is fixed, and the imagination less active, the vision fades into the light of common day. In considering St. Teresa's visions, we must remember that she was transparently honest and sincere; that her superiors strongly disliked and suspected, and her enemies ridiculed, her spiritual privileges; that at the same time they brought her great fame and influence; that she was at times haunted by doubts whether she ever really saw them; and, lastly, that her biographers have given them a more grotesque and materialistic character than is justified by her own descriptions.\",\n",
       " 'The little book called the German Theology, by an unknown author, also belongs to the school of Eckhart. It is one of the most precious treasures of devotional literature, and deserves to be better known than it is in this country. In some ways it is superior to the famous treatise of à Kempis, On the Imitation of Christ, since the self-centred individualism is less prominent. The author thoroughly understands Eckhart, but his object is not to view everything sub specie oeternitatis, but to give a practical religious turn to his master\\'s speculations. His teaching is closely in accordance with that of Tauler, whom he quotes as an authority, and whom he joins in denouncing the followers of the \"false light,\" the erratic mystics of the fourteenth century.',\n",

I mean the \"negative road\" to God, and the pantheistic tendency.',\n",
       " \"The mystic, as we have seen, makes it his life's aim to be transformed into the likeness of Him in whose image he was created.[15] He loves to figure his path as a ladder reaching from earth to heaven, which must be climbed step by step. This scala perfectionis is generally divided into three stages. The first is called the purgative life, the second the illuminative, while the third, which is really the goal rather than a part of the journey, is called the unitive life, or state of perfect contemplation.[16] We find, as we should expect, some differences in the classification, but this tripartite scheme is generally accepted.\",\n",
       " 'The mystic, then, is not, as such, a visionary; nor has he any interest in appealing to a faculty \"above reason,\" if reason is used in its proper sense, as the logic of the whole personality. The desire to find for our highest intuitions an authority wholly external to reason and independent of it,--a \"purely supernatural\" revelation,--has, as Récéjac says, \"been the cause of the longest and the most dangerous of the aberrations from which Mysticism has suffered.\" This kind of supernaturalism is destructive of unity in our ideas of God, the world, and ourselves; and it casts a slur on the faculties which are the appointed organs of communication between God and man. A revelation absolutely transcending reason is an absurdity: no such revelation could ever be made. In the striking phrase of Macarius, \"the human mind is the throne of the Godhead.\" The supremacy of the reason is the favourite theme of the Cambridge Platonists, two of whom, Whichcote and Culverwel, are never tired of quoting the text, \"The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.\" \"Sir, I oppose not rational to spiritual,\" writes Whichcote to Tuckney, \"for spiritual is most rational.\" And again, \"Reason is the Divine governor of man\\'s life: it is the very voice of God.[31]\" What we can and must transcend, if we would make any progress in Divine knowledge, is not reason, but that shallow rationalism which regards the data on which we can reason as a fixed quantity, known to all, and which bases itself on a formal logic, utterly unsuited to a spiritual view of things. Language can only furnish us with poor, misleading, and wholly inadequate images of spiritual facts; it supplies us with abstractions and metaphors, which do not really represent what we know or believe about God and human personality. St. Paul calls attention to this inadequacy by a series of formal contradictions: \"I live, yet not I\"; \"dying, and behold we live\"; \"when I am weak, then I am strong,\" and so forth; and we find exactly the same expedient in Plotinus, who is very fond of thus showing his contempt for the logic of identity. When, therefore, Harnack says that \"Mysticism is nothing else than rationalism applied to a sphere above reason,\" he would have done better to say that it is \"reason applied to a sphere above rationalism.[32]\"',\n",
       " 'The mystics are much inclined to adopt, in a modified form, the old notion of an anima mundi.

       " 'The next chapters show how this vision or presentiment was verified. The journeys which he now took exposed him to frequent dangers, both from robbers and from lawless men who hated the monks. One adventure with a murderer is told with delightful simplicity and vividness. Suso remains throughout his life thoroughly human, and, hard as his lot had been, he is in an agony of fear at the prospect of a violent death. The story of the outlaw confessing to the trembling monk how, besides other crimes, he had once pushed into the Rhine a priest who had just heard his confession, and how the wife of the assassin comforted Suso when he was about to drop down from sheer fright, forms a quaint interlude in the saint\\'s memoirs. But a more grievous trial awaited him. Among other pastoral work, he laboured much to reclaim fallen women; and a pretended penitent, whose insincerity he had detected, revenged herself by a slander which almost ruined him.[263] Happily, the chiefs of his order, whose verdict he had greatly dreaded, completely exonerated him, after a full investigation, and his last years seem to have been peaceful and happy. The closing chapters of the Life are taken up by some very interesting conversations with his spiritual \"daughter,\" Elizabeth Stäglin, who wished to understand the obscurer doctrines of Mysticism. She asks him about the doctrine of the Trinity, which he expounds on the general lines of Eckhart\\'s theology. She, however, remembers some of the bolder phrases in Eckhart, and says, \"But there are some who say that, in order to attain to perfect union, we must divest ourselves of God, and turn only to the inwardly-shining light.\" \"That is false,\" replies Suso, \"if the words are taken in their ordinary sense. But the common belief about God, that He is a great Taskmaster, whose function is to reward and punish, is cast out by perfect love; and in this sense the spiritual man does divest himself of God, as conceived of by the vulgar. Again, in the highest state of union, the soul takes no note of the Persons separately; for it is not the Divine Persons taken singly that confer bliss, but the Three in One.\" Suso here gives a really valuable turn to one of Eckhart\\'s rashest theses. \"Where is heaven?\" asks his pupil next. \"The intellectual where\" is the reply, \"is the essentially-existing unnameable nothingness. So we must call it, because we can discover no mode of being, under which to conceive of it. But though it seems to us to be no-thing, it deserves to be called something rather than nothing.\" Suso, we see, follows Dionysius, but with this proviso. The maiden now asks him to give her a figure or image of the self-evolution of the Trinity, and he gives her the figure of concentric circles, such as appear when we throw a stone into a pond. \"But,\" he adds, \"this is as unlike the formless truth as a black Moor is unlike the beautiful sun.\" Soon after, the holy maiden died, and Suso saw her in a vision, radiant and full of heavenly joy, showing him how, guided by his counsels, she had found everlasting bliss. When he came to himself, he said, \"Ah, God! blessed is the man who strives after Thee alone! He may well be content to suffer, whose pains Thou rewardest thus. God help us to rejoice in this maiden, and in all His dear friends, and to enjoy His Divine countenance eternally!\" So ends Suso\\'s autobiography. His other chief work, a Dialogue between the eternal Wisdom and the Servitor, is a prose poem of great beauty, the tenor of which may be inferred from the above extracts from the Life. Suso believed that the Divine Wisdom had indeed spoken through his pen; and few, I think, will accuse him of arrogance for the words which conclude the Dialogue. \"Whosoever will read these writings of mine in a right spirit, can hardly fail to be stirred in his heart\\'s depths, either to fervent love, or to new light, or to longing and thirsting for God, or to detestation and loathing of his sins, or to that spiritual aspiration by which the soul is renewed in grace.\"',\n",

A bold and independent thinker, he made it his aim to elucidate the vague theories of Dionysius, and to present them as a consistent philosophical system worked out by the help of Aristotle and perhaps Boethius.[212] He intends, of course, to keep within the limits permitted to Christian speculation; but in reality he does not allow dogma to fetter him. The Christian Alexandrians were, on the whole, more orthodox than their language; Erigena's language partially veils the real audacity of his speculation. He is a mystic only by his intellectual affinities;[213] the warmth of pious aspiration and love which makes Dionysius, amid all his extravagance, still a religious writer, has cooled entirely in Erigena. He can pray with fervour and eloquence for intellectual enlightenment; but there was nothing of the prophet or saint about him, to judge from his writings. Still, though one might dispute his title to be called either a Christian or a mystic, we must spare a few minutes to this last flower of Neoplatonism, which bloomed so late on our northern islands.\",\n",
       " 'The notion that salvation or deification consists in realising our true nature, was supported by the favourite doctrine that like only can know like. \"If the soul were not essentially Godlike ([Greek: theoeidês]), it could never know God.\" This doctrine might seem to lead to the heretical conclusion that man is [Greek: omoousios tô Patri] in the same sense as Christ. This conclusion, however, was strongly repudiated both by Clement and Origen. The former (Strom. xvi. 74) says that men are not [Greek: meros theou kai tô theô omoousioi]; and Origen (in Joh. xiii. 25) says it is very impious to assert that we are [Greek: omoousioi] with \"the unbegotten nature.\" But for those who thought of Christ mainly as the Divine Logos or universal Reason, the line was not very easy to draw. Methodius says that every believer must, through participation in Christ, be born as a Christ,--a view which, if pressed logically (as it ought not to be), implies either that our nature is at bottom identical with that of Christ, or that the life of Christ is substituted for our own. The difficulty as to whether the human soul is, strictly speaking, \"divinæ particula auræ,\" is met by Proclus in the ingenious and interesting passage quoted p. 34; \"There are,\" he says, \"three sorts of wholes, (1) in which the whole is anterior to the parts, (2) in which the whole is composed of the parts, (3) which knits into one stuff the parts and the whole ([Greek: hê tois holois ta merê sunyphainousa]).\" This is also the doctrine of Plotinus, and of Augustine. God is not split up among His creatures, nor are they essential to Him in the same way as He is to them. Erigena\\'s doctrine of deification is expressed (not very clearly) in the following sentence (De Div. Nat. iii. 9): \"Est igitur participatio divinæ essentiæ assumptio. Assumptio vero eius divinæ sapientiæ fusio quæ est omnium substantia et essentia, et quæcumque in eis naturaliter intelliguntur.\" According to Eckhart, the Wesen of God transforms the soul into itself by means of the \"spark\" or \"apex of the soul\" (equivalent to Plotinus\\' [Greek: kentron psychês], Enn. vi. 9. 8), which is \"so akin to God that it is one with God, and not merely united to Him.\"',\n",
       " \"The obiter dicta on Mysticism in Nettleship's Remains are of great value.\",\n",
       " 'The objection may be raised--\"But these beliefs change, and merely reflect the degree of enlightenment or its opposite, which every man has reached.\" The conscience of the savage tells him emphatically that there are some things which he must not do; and blind obedience to this \"categorical imperative\" has produced not only all the complex absurdities of \"taboo,\" but crimes like human sacrifice, and faith in a great many things that are not. \"Perhaps we are leaving behind the theological stage, as we have already left behind those superstitions of savagery.\" Now the study of primitive religions does seem to me to prove the danger of resting religion and morality on unreasoning obedience to a supposed revelation; but that is not my position. The two forces which kill mischievous superstitions are the knowledge of nature, and the moral sense; and we are quite ready to give both free play, confident that both come from the living Word of God. The fact that a revelation is progressive is no argument that it is not Divine: it is, in fact, only when the free current of the religious life is dammed up that it turns into a swamp, and poisons human society. Of course we must be ready to admit with all humility, that our notions of God are probably unworthy and distorted enough; but that is no reason why we should not follow the light which we have, or mistrust it on the ground that it is \"too good to be true.\"',\n",
       " 'The other development of the theory that man is a microcosm is not less important and interesting. It is a favourite doctrine of the mystics that man, in his individual life, recapitulates the spiritual history of the race, in much the same way in which embryologists tell us that the unborn infant recapitulates the whole process of physical evolution. It follows that the Incarnation, the central fact of human history, must have its analogue in the experience of the individual. We shall find that this doctrine of the birth of an infant Christ in the soul is one of immense importance in the systems of Eckhart, Tauler, and our Cambridge Platonists. It is a somewhat perilous doctrine, as we shall see; but it is one which, I venture to think, has a future as well as a past, for the progress of modern science has greatly strengthened the analogies on which it rests. I shall show in my next Lecture how strongly St. Paul felt its value.',\n",
       " 'The other view of deification, that of a substitution of the Divine Will, or Life, or Spirit, for the human, cannot in history be sharply distinguished from the theories which have just been mentioned. But the idea of substitution is naturally most congenial to those who feel strongly \"the corruption of man\\'s heart,\" and the need of deliverance, not only from our ghostly enemies, but from the tyranny of self. Such men feel that there must be a real change, affecting the very depths of our personality. Righteousness must be imparted, not merely imputed. And there is a death to be died as well as a life to be lived. The old man must die before the new man, which is \"not I but Christ,\" can be born in us. The \"birth of God (or Christ) in the soul\" is a favourite doctrine of the later German mystics. Passages from the fourteenth century writers have been quoted in my fourth and fifth Lectures. The following from Giseler may be added: \"God will be born, not in the Reason, not in the Will, but in the most inward part of the essence, and all the faculties of the soul become aware thereof. Thereby the soul passes into mere passivity, and lets God work.\" They all insist on an immediate, substantial, personal indwelling, which is beyond what Aquinas and the Schoolmen taught. The Lutheran Church condemns those who teach that only the gifts of God, and not God Himself, dwell in the believer; and the English Platonists, as we have seen, insist that \"an infant Christ\" is really born in the soul. The German mystics are equally emphatic about the annihilation of the old man, which is the condition of this indwelling Divine life. In quietistic (Nominalist) Mysticism the usual phrase was that the will (or, better, \"self-will\") must be utterly destroyed, so that the Divine Will may take its place. But Crashaw\\'s \"leave nothing of myself in me,\" represents the aspiration of the later Catholic Mysticism generally. St. Juan of the Cross says, \"The soul must lose entirely its human knowledge and human feelings, in order to receive Divine knowledge and Divine feelings\"; it will then live \"as it were outside itself,\" in a state \"more proper to the future than to the present life.\" It is easy to see how dangerous such teaching may be to weak heads. A typical example, at a much earlier date, is that of Mechthild of Hackeborn (about 1240). It was she who said, \"My soul swims in the Godhead like a fish in water!\" and who believed that, in answer to her prayers, God had so united Himself with her that she saw with His eyes, and heard with His ears, and spoke with His mouth. Many similar examples might be found among the mediæval mystics.',\n",
       " 'The passage from the Colossians, which I quoted just now, contains another mystical idea besides that of Christ as the universal source and centre of life. He is, we are told, \"the Image of the invisible God,\" and all created beings are, in their several capacities, images of Him. Man is essentially \"the image and glory of God\";[93] the \"perfect man\" is he who has come \"to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.[94]\" This is our nature, in the Aristotelian sense of completed normal development; but to reach it we have to slay the false self, the old man, which is informed by an actively maleficent agency, \"flesh\" which is hostile to \"spirit.\" This latter conception does not at present concern us; what we have to notice is the description of the upward path as an inner transit from the false isolation of the natural man into a state in which it is possible to say, \"I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.[95]\" In the Epistle to the Galatians he uses the favourite mystical phrase, \"until Christ be formed in you\";[96] and in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians[97] he employs a most beautiful expression in describing the process, reverting to the figure of the \"mirror,\" dear to Mysticism, which he had already used in the First Epistle: \"We all with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory.\" Other passages, which refer primarily to the future state, are valuable as showing that St. Paul lends no countenance to that abstract idea of eternal life as freedom from all earthly conditions, which has misled so many mystics. Our hope, when the earthly house of our tabernacle is dissolved, is not that we may be unclothed, but that we may be clothed upon with our heavenly habitation. The body of our humiliation is to be changed and glorified, according to the mighty working whereby God is able to subdue all things unto Himself. And therefore our whole spirit and soul and body must be preserved blameless; for the body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, not the prison-house of a soul which will one day escape out of its cage and fly away.',\n",
       " 'The perverted form of primitive Animism is called Fetishism, which is the belief that supernatural powers reside in some visible object, which is the home or most treasured possession of a god or demon. The object may be a building, a tree, an animal, a particular kind of food, or indeed anything. Unfortunately this belief is not peculiar to savages. A degraded form of it is exhibited by the so-called neo-mystical school of modern France, and in the baser types of Roman Catholicism everywhere[332].',\n",
       " 'The phase of thought or feeling which we call Mysticism has its origin in that which is the raw material of all religion, and perhaps of all philosophy and art as well, namely, that dim consciousness of the beyond, which is part of our nature as human beings. Men have given different names to these \"obstinate questionings of sense and outward things.\" We may call them, if we will, a sort of higher instinct, perhaps an anticipation of the evolutionary process; or an extension of the frontier of consciousness; or, in religious language, the voice of God speaking to us. Mysticism arises when we try to bring this higher consciousness into relation with the other contents of our minds. Religious Mysticism may be defined as the attempt to realise the presence of the living God in the soul and in nature, or, more generally, as the attempt to realise, in thought and feeling, the immanence of the temporal in the eternal, and of the eternal in the temporal. Our consciousness of the beyond is, I say, the raw material of all religion. But, being itself formless, it cannot be brought directly into relation with the forms of our thought. Accordingly, it has to express itself by symbols, which are as it were the flesh and bones of ideas. It is the tendency of all symbols to petrify or evaporate, and either process is fatal to them. They soon repudiate their mystical origin, and forthwith lose their religious content. Then comes a return to the fresh springs of the inner life--a revival of spirituality in the midst of formalism or unbelief. This is the historical function of Mysticism--it appears as an independent active principle, the spirit of reformations and revivals. But since every active principle must find for itself appropriate instruments, Mysticism has developed a speculative and practical system of its own. As Goethe says, it is \"the scholastic of the heart, the dialectic of the feelings.\" In this way it becomes possible to consider it as a type of religion, though it must always be remembered that in becoming such it has incorporated elements which do not belong to its inmost being.[7] As a type of religion, then, Mysticism seems to rest on the following propositions or articles of faith:--',\n",
       " \"The philosophical side of the subject is from my point of view of much greater importance. I have done my best to acquire an adequate knowledge of those philosophies, both ancient and modern, which are most akin to speculative Mysticism, and also to think out my own position. I hope that I have succeeded in indicating my general standpoint, and that what I have written may prove fairly consistent and intelligible; but I have felt keenly the disadvantage of having missed the systematic training in metaphysics given by the Oxford school of Literæ Humaniores, and also the difficulty (perhaps I should say the presumption) of addressing metaphysical arguments to an audience which included several eminent philosophers. I wish also that I had had time for a more thorough study of Fechner's works; for his system, so far as I understand it, seems to me to have a great interest and value as a scheme of philosophical Mysticism which does not clash with modern science.\",\n",
       " 'The practical theology of these four German mystics of the fourteenth century--Ruysbroek, Suso, Tauler, and the writer of the German Theology, is so similar that it is possible to consider it in detail without taking each author separately. It is the crowning achievement of Christian Mysticism before the Reformation, except in the English Platonists of the seventeenth century, we shall not find anywhere a sounder and more complete scheme of doctrine built upon this foundation.',\n",
       " 'The principle, \"Cuique in sua arte credendum est,\" applies to those who have been eminent for personal holiness as much as to the leaders in any other branch of excellence. Even in dealing with arts which are akin to each other, we do not invite poets to judge of music, or sculptors of architecture. We need not then be disturbed if we occasionally find men illustrious in other fields, who are as insensible to religion as to poetry. Our reverence for the character and genius of Charles Darwin need not induce us to lay aside either our Shakespeare or our New Testament.[405] The men to whom we naturally turn as our best authorities in spiritual matters, are those who seem to have been endowed with an \"anima naturaliter Christiana,\" and who have devoted their whole lives to the service of God and the imitation of Christ.',\n",
       " 'The problem for the Church was how to encourage the warm love and faith of the mystics without giving the rein to these mischievous errors. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries produced several famous writers, who attempted to combine scholasticism and Mysticism.[222] The leaders in this attempt were Bernard,[223] Hugo and Richard of St. Victor, Bonaventura, Albertus Magnus, and (later) Gerson. Their works are not of great value as contributions to religious philosophy, for the Schoolmen were too much afraid of their authorities--Catholic tradition and Aristotle--to probe difficulties to the bottom; and the mystics, who, by making the renewed life of the soul their starting-point, were more independent, were debarred, by their ignorance of Greek, from a first-hand knowledge of their intellectual ancestors. But in the history of Mysticism they hold an important place.[224] Speculation being for them restricted within the limits of Church-dogma, they were obliged to be more psychological and less metaphysical than Dionysius or Erigena. The Victorines insist often on self-knowledge as the way to the knowledge of God and on self-purification as more important than philosophy. \"The way to ascend to God,\" says Hugo, \"is to descend into oneself.[225]\" \"The ascent is through self above self,\" says Richard; we are to rise on stepping-stones of our dead selves to higher things. \"Let him that thirsts to see God clean his mirror, let him make his own spirit bright,\" says Richard again. The Victorines do not disparage reason, which is the organ by which mankind in general apprehend the things of God; but they regard ecstatic contemplation as a supra-rational state or faculty, which can only be reached per mentis excessum, and in which the naked truth is seen, no longer in a glass darkly.[226]',\n",
       " 'The process of deification is thus described by Ruysbroek and by Tauler. Ruysbroek writes: \"All men who are exalted above their creatureliness into a contemplative life are one with this Divine glory--yea, are that glory. And they see and feel and find in themselves, by means of this Divine light, that they are the same simple Ground as to their uncreated nature, since the glory shineth forth without measure, after the Divine manner, and abideth within them simply and without mode, according to the simplicity of the essence. Wherefore contemplative men should rise above reason and distinction, beyond their created substance, and gaze perpetually by the aid of their inborn light, and so they become transformed, and one with the same light, by means of which they see, and which they see. Thus they arrive at that eternal image after which they were created, and contemplate God and all things without distinction, in a simple beholding, in Divine glory. This is the loftiest and most profitable contemplation to which men attain in this life.\" Tauler, in his sermon for the Fifteenth Sunday after Trinity, says: \"The kingdom is seated in the inmost recesses of the spirit. When, through all manner of exercises, the outward man has been converted into the inward reasonable man, and thus the two, that is to say, the powers of the senses and the powers of the reason, are gathered up into the very centre of the man\\'s being,--the unseen depths of his spirit, wherein lies the image of God,--and thus he flings himself into the Divine Abyss, in which he dwelt eternally before he was created; then when God finds the man thus firmly down and turned towards Him, the Godhead bends and nakedly descends into the depths of the pure waiting soul, and transforms the created soul, drawing it up into the uncreated essence, so that the spirit becomes one with Him. Could such a man behold himself, he would see himself so noble that he would fancy himself God, and see himself a thousand times nobler than he is in himself, and would perceive all the thoughts and purposes, words and works, and have all the knowledge of all men that ever were.\" Suso and the German Theology use similar language.',\n",
       " 'The purgative life necessarily includes self-discipline: does it necessarily include what is commonly known as asceticism? It would be easy to answer that asceticism means nothing but training, as men train for a race, or more broadly still, that it means simply \"the acquisition of some greater power by practice.[19]\" But when people speak of \"asceticism,\" they have in their minds such severe \"buffeting\" of the body as was practised by many ancient hermits and mediæval monks. Is this an integral part of the mystic\\'s \"upward path\"? We shall find reason to conclude that, while a certain degree of austere simplicity characterises the outward life of nearly all the mystics, and while an almost morbid desire to suffer is found in many of them, there is nothing in the system itself to encourage men to maltreat their bodies. Mysticism enjoins a dying life, not a living death. Moreover, asceticism, when regarded as a virtue or duty in itself, tends to isolate us, and concentrates our attention on our separate individuality. This is contrary to the spirit of Mysticism, which aims at realising unity and solidarity everywhere. Monkish asceticism (so far as it goes beyond the struggle to live unstained under unnatural conditions) rests on a dualistic view of the world which does not belong to the essence of Mysticism. It infected all the religious life of the Middle Ages, not Mysticism only.[20]',\n",
       " 'The question has been much debated, whether the influence of Persian and Indian thought can be traced in Neoplatonism, or whether that system was purely Greek.[151] It is a quite hopeless task to try to disentangle the various strands of thought which make up the web of Alexandrianism. But there is no doubt that the philosophers of Asia were held in reverence at this period. Origen, in justifying an esoteric mystery-religion for the educated, and a mythical religion for the vulgar, appeals to the example of the \"Persians and Indians.\" And Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius of Tyana, says, or makes his hero say, that while all wish to live in the presence of God, \"the Indians alone succeed in doing so.\" And certainly there are parts of Plotinus, and still more of his successors, which strongly suggest Asiatic influences.[152] When we turn from Alexandria to Syria, we find Orientalism more rampant. Speculation among the Syrian monks of the third, fourth, and fifth centuries was perhaps more unfettered and more audacious than in any other branch of Christendom at any period. Our knowledge of their theories is very limited, but one strange specimen has survived in the book of Hierotheus,[153] which the canonised Dionysius praises in glowing terms as an inspired oracle--indeed, he professes that his own object in writing was merely to popularise the teaching of his master. The book purports to be the work of Hierotheus, a holy man converted by St. Paul, and an instructor of the real Dionysius the Areopagite. A strong case has been made out for believing the real author to be a Syrian mystic, named Stephen bar Sudaili, who lived late in the fifth century. If this theory is correct, the date of Dionysius will have to be moved somewhat later than it has been the custom to fix it. The book of the holy Hierotheus on \"the hidden mysteries of the Divinity\" has been but recently discovered, and only a summary of it has as yet been made public. But it is of great interest and importance for our subject, because the author has no fear of being accused of Pantheism or any other heresy, but develops his particular form of Mysticism to its logical conclusions with unexampled boldness. He will show us better even than his pupil Dionysius whither the method of \"analysis\" really leads us.',\n",
       " 'The question was naturally raised, \"If man by putting on Christ\\'s life can get nothing more than he has already, what good will it do him?\" The answer in the Theologia Germanica is as follows: \"This life is not chosen in order to serve any end, or to get anything by it, but for love of its nobleness, and because God loveth and esteemeth it so greatly.\" It is plain that any view which regards man as essentially Divine has to face great difficulties when it comes to deal with theodicy.',\n",
       " 'The quietistic controversy in France was carried on in an atmosphere of political intrigues and private jealousies, which in no way concern us. But the great fact which stands out above the turmoil of calumny and misrepresentation is that the Roman Church, which in sore straits had called in the help of quietistic Mysticism to stem the flood of Protestantism, at length found the alliance too dangerous, and disbanded her irregular troops in spite of their promises to submit to discipline. In Fénelon, Mysticism had a champion eloquent and learned, and not too logical to repudiate with honest conviction consequences which some of his authorities had found it necessary to accept. He remained a loyal and submissive son of the Church, as did Molinos; and was, in fact, more guarded in his statements than Bossuet, who in his ignorance of mystical theology often blundered into dangerous admissions[314]. But the Jesuits saw with their usual acumen that Mysticism, even in the most submissive guise, is an independent and turbulent spirit; and by condemning Fénelon as well as Molinos, they crushed it out as a religious movement in the Latin countries.',\n",
       " 'The real world, according to thinkers of this school, is created by the thought and will of God, and exists in His mind. It is therefore spiritual, and above space and time, which are only the forms under which reality is set out as a process.',\n",
       " 'The religious objection amounts to little more than that Mysticism has not succeeded in solving the problem of evil, which no philosophy has ever attacked with even apparent success. It is, however, with some reason that this difficulty has been pressed against the mystics; for they are bound by their principles to attempt some solution, and their tendency has been to attenuate the positive character of evil to a somewhat dangerous degree. But if we sift the charges often brought by religious writers against Mysticism, we shall generally find that there lies at the bottom of their disapproval a residuum of mediæval dualism, which wishes to see in Christ the conquering invader of a hostile kingdom. In practice, at any rate, the great mystics have not taken lightly the struggle with the law of sin in our members, or tried to \"heal slightly\" the wounds of the soul.[391]',\n",
       " 'The sacraments of Baptism and the Lord\\'s Supper fulfil these conditions. Both are symbols of the mystical union between the Christian and his ascended Lord. Baptism symbolises that union in its inception, the Eucharist in its organic life. Baptism is received but once, because the death unto sin and the new birth unto righteousness is a definite entrance into the spiritual life, rather than a gradual process. The fact that in Christian countries Baptism in most cases precedes conversion does not alter the character of the sacrament; indeed, infant Baptism is by far the most appropriate symbol of our adoption into the Divine Sonship, to which we only consent after the event. It is only because we are already sons that we can say, \"I will arise, and go unto my Father.\" The Holy Communion is the symbol of the maintenance of the mystical union, and of the \"strengthening and refreshing of our souls,\" which we derive from the indwelling presence of our Lord. The Church claims an absolute prerogative for its duly ordained ministers in the case of this sacrament, because the common meal is the symbol of the organic unity of Christ and the Church as \"unus Christus,\" a doctrine which the schismatic, as such, denies.[327] The communicant who believes only in an individual relation between Christ and separate persons, or in an \"invisible Church,\" does not understand the meaning of the sacrament of the Lord\\'s Supper, and can hardly be said to participate in it.',\n",
       " 'The second Person of the Trinity contains in Himself the archetypes of everything. He is the \"elementum,\" \"habitaculum,\" \"habitator,\" \"locus\" of the universe. The material world was created for man\\'s probation. All spirits pre-existed, and their partial immersion in an impure material environment is a degradation from which they must aspire to be delivered. But the whole mundane history of a soul is only the realisation of the idea which had existed from all eternity in the mind of God. These doctrines show that Victorinus is involved in a dualistic view of matter, and in a form of predestinarianism; but he has no definite teaching on the relation of sin to the ideal world.',\n",
       " 'The second is the belief in the immanence of a God who is also transcendent. This should be called Panentheism, a useful word coined by Krause, and not Pantheism. In its true form it is an integral part of Christian philosophy, and, indeed, of all rational theology. But in proportion as the indwelling of God, or of Christ, or the Holy Spirit in the heart of man, is regarded as an opus operatum, or as complete substitution of the Divine for the human, we are in danger of a self-deification which resembles the maddest phase of Pantheism[187].',\n",
       " 'The second point in which St. Paul has been supposed to sanction an exaggerated form of Mysticism, is his extreme disparagement of external religion--of forms and ceremonies and holy days and the like. \"One man hath faith to eat all things; but he that is weak eateth herbs.[101]\" \"One man esteemeth one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike.\" \"He that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, and giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.\" \"Why turn ye back to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage again? Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years. I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.[102]\" \"Why do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, handle not, nor taste, nor touch, after the precepts and doctrines of men?[103]\" These are strongly-worded passages, and I have no wish to attenuate their significance. Any Christian priest who puts the observance of human ordinances-- fast-days, for example--at all on the same level as such duties as charity, generosity, or purity, is teaching, not Christianity, but that debased Judaism against which St. Paul waged an unceasing polemic, and which is one of those dead religions which has to be killed again in almost every generation.[104] But we must not forget that these vigorous denunciations do occur in a polemic against Judaism. They bear the stamp of the time at which they were written perhaps more than any other part of St. Paul\\'s Epistles, except those thoughts which were connected with his belief in the approaching end of the world. St. Paul certainly did not intend his Christian converts to be anarchists in religious matters. There is evidence, in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, that his spiritual presentation of Christianity had already been made an excuse for disorderly licence. The usual symptoms of degenerate Mysticism had appeared at Corinth. There were men there who called themselves \"spiritual persons[105]\" or prophets, and showed an arrogant independence; there were others who wished to start sects of their own; others who carried antinomianism into the sphere of morals; others who prided themselves on various \"spiritual gifts.\" As regards the last class, we are rather surprised at the half-sanction which the apostle gives to what reads like primitive Irvingism;[106] but he was evidently prepared to enforce discipline with a strong hand. Still, it may be fairly said that he trusts mainly to his personal ascendancy, and to his teaching about the organic unity of the Christian body, to preserve or restore due discipline and cohesion. There have been hardly any religious leaders, if we except George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, who have valued ceremonies so little. In this, again, he is a genuine mystic.',\n",
       " 'The second point is one which may seem to be of subordinate importance, but it will, I think, awaken more interest in the future than it has done in the past. In the 8th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, St. Paul clearly teaches that the victory of Christ over sin and death is of import, not only to humanity, but to the whole of creation, which now groans and travails in pain together, but which shall one day be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. This recognition of the spirituality of matter, and of the unity of all nature in Christ, is one which we ought to be thankful to find in the New Testament. It will be my pleasant task, in the last two Lectures of this course, to show how the later school of mystics prized it.',\n",
       " 'The second proposition is that, since we can only know what is akin to ourselves,[8] man, in order to know God, must be a partaker of the Divine nature. \"What we are, that we behold; and what we behold, that we are,\" says Ruysbroek. The curious doctrine which we find in the mystics of the Middle Ages, that there is at \"the apex of the mind\" a spark which is consubstantial with the uncreated ground of the Deity, is thus accounted for. We could not even begin to work out our own salvation if God were not already working in us. It is always \"in His light\" that \"we see light.\" The doctrine has been felt to be a necessary postulate by most philosophers who hold that knowledge of God is possible to man. For instance, Krause says, \"From finite reason as finite we might possibly explain the thought of itself, but not the thought of something that is outside finite reasonable beings, far less the absolute idea, in its contents infinite, of God. To become aware of God in knowledge we require certainly to make a freer use of our finite power of thought, but the thought of God itself is primarily and essentially an eternal operation of the eternal revelation of God to the finite mind.\" But though we are made in the image of God, our likeness to Him only exists potentially.[9] The Divine spark already shines within us, but it has to be searched for in the innermost depths of our personality, and its light diffused over our whole being.',\n",
       " 'The second stage, the illuminative life, is the concentration of all the faculties, will, intellect, and feeling, upon God. It differs from the purgative life, not in having discarded good works, but in having come to perform them, as Fénelon says, \"no longer as virtues,\" that is to say, willingly and almost spontaneously. The struggle is now transferred to the inner life.',\n",
       " 'The secrecy observed about creeds and liturgical forms had not much to do with the development of Mysticism, except by associating sacredness with obscurity (cf. Strabo, x. 467, [Greek: hê krypsis hê mystikê semnopoiei to theion, mimoumenê tên physin autou ekpheugousan tên aisthêsin]), a tendency which also showed itself in the love of symbolism. This certainly had a great influence, both in the form of allegorism (cf. Clem. Strom, i. 1. 15, [Greek: esti de ha kai ainixetai moi hê graphê; peirasetai de kai ganthanousa eipein kai epikryptomenê ekphênai kai deixai siôpôsa]), which Philo calls \"the method of the Greek Mysteries,\" and in the various kinds of Nature-Mysticism. The great value of the Mysteries lay in the facilities which they offered for free symbolical interpretation.',\n",
       " 'The soul in its ascent passes from one realm of darkness to another. First there is the \"night of sense,\" in which the things of earth become dark to her. This must needs be traversed, for \"the creatures are only the crumbs that fall from God\\'s table, and none but dogs will turn to pick them up.\" \"One desire only doth God allow--that of obeying Him, and carrying the Cross.\" All other desires weaken, torment, blind, and pollute the soul. Until we are completely detached from all such, we cannot love God. \"When thou dwellest upon anything, thou hast ceased to cast thyself upon the All.\" \"If thou wilt keep anything with the All, thou hast not thy treasure simply in God.\" \"Empty thy spirit of all created things, and thou wilt walk in the Divine light, for God resembles no created thing.\" Such is the method of traversing the \"night of sense.\" Even at this early stage the forms and symbols of eternity, which others have found in the visible works of God, are discarded as useless. \"God has no resemblance to any creature.\" The dualism or acosmism of mediæval thought has seldom found a harsher expression.',\n",
       " 'The soul is bipartite. The higher portion sees the \"Divine images\" directly, the lower by means of symbols. The latter are not to be despised, for they are \"true impressions of the Divine characters,\" and necessary steps, which enable us to \"mount to the one undivided truth by analogy.\" This is the way in which we should use the Scriptures. They have a symbolic truth and beauty, which is intelligible only to those who can free themselves from the \"puerile myths[168]\" (the language is startling in a saint of the Church!) in which they are sometimes embedded.',\n",
       " 'The soul is with him the meeting-point of the intelligible and the phenomenal. It is diffused everywhere.[126] Animals and vegetables participate in it;[127] and the earth has a soul which sees and hears.[128] The soul is immaterial and immortal, for it belongs to the world of real existence, and nothing that is can cease to be.[129] The body is in the soul, rather than the soul in the body. The soul creates the body by imposing form on matter, which in itself is No-thing, pure indetermination, and next door to absolute non-existence.[130] Space and time are only forms of our thought. The concepts formed by the soul, by classifying the things of sense, are said to be \"Ideas unrolled and separate,\" that is, they are conceived as separate in space and time, instead of existing all together in eternity. The nature of the soul is triple; it is presented under three forms, which are at the same time the three stages of perfection which it can reach.[131] There is first and lowest the animal and sensual soul, which is closely bound up with the body; then there is the logical, reasoning soul, the distinctively human part; and, lastly, there is the superhuman stage or part, in which a man \"thinks himself according to the higher intelligence, with which he has become identified, knowing himself no longer as a man, but as one who has become altogether changed, and has transferred himself into the higher region.\" The soul is thus \"made one with Intelligence without losing herself; so that they two are both one and two.\" This is exactly Eckhart\\'s doctrine of the funkelein, if we identify Plotinus\\' [Greek: Nous] with Eckhart\\'s \"God,\" as we may fairly do. The soul is not altogether incarnate in the body; part of it remains above, in the intelligible world, whither it desires to return in its entirety.',\n",

This is the true God, and eternal life.\" The evangelist is constantly trying to transport us into that timeless region in which one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.',\n",
       " 'The steps of the upward path constitute the ethical system, the rule of life, of the mystics. The first stage, the purgative life, we read in the Theologia Germanica, is brought about by contrition, by confession, by hearty amendment; and this is the usual language in treatises intended for monks. But it is really intended to include the civic and social virtues in this stage.[17] They occupy the lowest place, it is true; but this only means that they must be acquired by all, though all are not called to the higher flights of contemplation. Their chief value, according to Plotinus, is to teach us the meaning of order and limitation ([Greek: taxis] and [Greek: peras]), which are qualities belonging to the Divine nature. This is a very valuable thought, for it contradicts that aberration of Mysticism which calls God the Infinite, and thinks of Him as the Indefinite, dissolving all distinctions in the abyss of bare indetermination. When Ewald says, \"the true mystic never withdraws himself wilfully from the business of life, no, not even from the smallest business,\" he is, at any rate, saying nothing which conflicts with the principles of Mysticism.[18]',\n",
       " 'The subject of Nature-Mysticism is a fascinating one; but I must here confine myself to its religious aspects. An attempt was soon made, by Valentine Weigel (1533-1588), Lutheran pastor at Tschopau, to bring together the new objective Mysticism--freed from its superstitious elements--and the traditional subjective Mysticism which the Middle Ages had handed down from Dionysius and the Neoplatonists. Weigel\\'s cosmology is based on that of Paracelsus; and his psychology also reminds us of him. Man is a microcosm, and his nature has three parts--the outward material body, the astral spirit, and the immortal soul, which bears the image of God. The three faculties of the soul correspond to these three parts; they are sense, reason (Vernunft), and understanding (Verstand). These are the \"three eyes\" by which we get knowledge. The sense perceives material things; the reason, natural science and art; the understanding, which he also calls the spark, sees the invisible and Divine. He follows the scholastic mystics in distinguishing between natural and supernatural knowledge, but his method of distinguishing them is, I think, original. Natural knowledge, he says, is not conveyed by the object; it is the percipient subject which creates knowledge out of itself. The object merely provokes the consciousness into activity. In natural knowledge the subject is \"active, not passive\"; all that appears to come from without is really evolved from within. In supernatural knowledge the opposite is the case. The eye of the \"understanding,\" which sees the Divine, is the spark in the centre of the soul where lies the Divine image. In this kind of cognition the subject must be absolutely passive; its thoughts must be as still as if it were dead. Just as in natural knowledge the object does not co-operate, so in supernatural knowledge the subject does not co-operate. Yet this supernatural knowledge does not come from without. The Spirit and Word of God are within us. God is Himself the eye and the light in the soul, as well as the object which the eye sees by this light. Supernatural knowledge flows from within outwards, and in this way resembles natural knowledge. But since God is both the eye that sees and the object which it sees, it is not we who know God, so much as God who knows Himself in us. Our inner man is a mere instrument of God.',\n",
       " 'The subject of St. Paul\\'s visions and revelations is one of great difficulty. In the Acts we have full accounts of the appearance in the sky which caused, or immediately preceded, his conversion. It is quite clear that St. Paul himself regarded this as an appearance of the same kind as the other Christophanies granted to apostles and \"brethren,\" and of a different kind from such visions as might be seen by any Christian. It was an unique favour, conferring upon him the apostolic prerogatives of an eye-witness. Other passages in the Acts show that during his missionary journeys St. Paul saw visions and heard voices, and that he believed himself to be guided by the \"Spirit of Jesus.\" Lastly, in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians he records that \"more than fourteen years ago\" he was in an ecstasy, in which he was \"caught up into the third heaven,\" and saw things unutterable. The form in which this experience is narrated suggests a recollection of Rabbinical pseudo-science; the substance of the vision St. Paul will not reveal, nor will he claim its authority for any of his teaching.[80] These recorded experiences are of great psychological interest; but, as I said in my last Lecture, they do not seem to me to belong to the essence of Mysticism.',\n",
       " 'The system of Hierotheus is not exactly Pantheism, but Pan-Nihilism. Everything is an emanation from the Chaos of bare indetermination which he calls God, and everything will return thither. There are three periods of existence--(1) the present world, which is evil, and is characterised by motion; (2) the progressive union with Christ, who is all and in all--this is the period of rest; (3) the period of fusion of all things in the Absolute. The three Persons of the Trinity, he dares to say, will then be swallowed up, and even the devils are thrown into the same melting-pot. Consistently with mystical principles, these three world-periods are also phases in the development of individual souls. In the first stage the mind aspires towards its first principles; in the second it becomes Christ, the universal Mind; in the third its personality is wholly merged. The greater part of the book is taken up with the adventures of the Mind in climbing the ladder of perfection; it is a kind of theosophical romance, much more elaborate and fantastic than the \"revelations\" of mediæval mystics. The author professes to have himself enjoyed the ecstatic union more than once, and his method of preparing for it is that of the Quietists: \"To me it seems right to speak without words, and understand without knowledge, that which is above words and knowledge; this I apprehend to be nothing but the mysterious silence and mystical quiet which destroys consciousness and dissolves forms. Seek, therefore, silently and mystically, that perfect and primitive union with the Arch-Good.\"',\n",
       " 'The teaching of this Gospel on the office of the Holy Spirit claims special attention in our present inquiry. The revelation of God in Christ was complete: there can be no question that St. John claims for Christianity the position of the one eternally true revelation. But without the gradual illumination of the Spirit it is partly unintelligible and partly unobserved.[63] The purpose of the Incarnation was to reveal God the Father: \"He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.\" In these momentous words (it has been said) \"the idea of God receives an abiding embodiment, and the Father is brought for ever within the reach of intelligent devotion.[64]\" The purpose of the mission of the Comforter is to reveal the Son. He takes the place of the ascended Christ on earth as a living and active principle in the hearts of Christians. His office it is to bring to remembrance the teachings of Christ, and to help mankind gradually to understand them. There were also many things, our Lord said, which could not be said at the time to His disciples, who were unable to bear them. These were left to be communicated to future generations by the Holy Spirit. The doctrine of development had never before received so clear an expression; and few could venture to record it so clearly as St. John, who could not be suspected of contemplating a time when the teachings of the human Christ might be superseded.',\n",
       " 'The theory that we can approach God only by analysis or abstraction has already been briefly commented on. It is no invention of Dionysius. Plotinus uses similar language, though his view of God as the fulness of all life prevented him from following the negative path with thoroughness. But in Proclus we find the phrases, afterwards so common, about \"sinking into the Divine Ground,\" \"forsaking the manifold for the One,\" and so forth. Basilides, long before, evidently carried the doctrine to its extremity: \"We must not even call God ineffable,\" he says, \"since this is to make an assertion about Him; He is above every name that is named.[171]\" It was a commonplace of Christian instruction to say that \"in Divine matters there is great wisdom in confessing our ignorance\"--this phrase occurs in Cyril\\'s catechism.[172] But confessing our ignorance is a very different thing from refusing to make any positive statements about God. It is true that all our language about God must be inadequate and symbolic; but that is no reason for discarding all symbols, as if we could in that way know God as He knows Himself. At the bottom, the doctrine that God can be described only by negatives is neither Christian nor Greek, but belongs to the old religion of India. Let me try to state the argument and its consequence in a clear form. Since God is the Infinite, and the Infinite is the antithesis of the finite, every attribute which can be affirmed of a finite being may be safely denied of God. Hence God can only be described by negatives; He can only be discovered by stripping off all the qualities and attributes which veil Him; He can only be reached by divesting ourselves of all the distinctions of personality, and sinking or rising into our \"uncreated nothingness\"; and He can only be imitated by aiming at an abstract spirituality, the passionless \"apathy\" of an universal which is nothing in particular. Thus we see that the whole of those developments of Mysticism which despise symbols, and hope to see God by shutting the eye of sense, hang together. They all follow from the false notion of God as the abstract Unity transcending, or rather excluding, all distinctions. Of course, it is not intended to exclude distinctions, but to rise above them; but the process of abstraction, or subtraction, as it really is, can never lead us to \"the One.[173]\" The only possible unification with such an Infinite is the [Greek: atermôn nêgretos hupnos] of Nirvana.[174] Nearly all that repels us in mediæval religious life--its \"other-worldliness\" and passive hostility to civilisation--the emptiness of its ideal life--its maltreatment of the body--its disparagement of family life--the respect which it paid to indolent contemplation--springs from this one root. But since no one who remains a Christian can exhibit the results of this theory in their purest form, I shall take the liberty of quoting a few sentences from a pamphlet written by a native Indian judge who I believe is still living. His object is to explain and commend to Western readers the mystical philosophy of his own country:[175]--\"He who in perfect rest rises from the body and attains the highest light, comes forth in his own proper form. This is the immortal soul. The ascent is by the ladder of one\\'s thoughts. To know God, one must first know one\\'s own spirit in its purity, unspotted by thought. The soul is hidden behind the veil of thought, and only when thought is worn off, becomes visible to itself. This stage is called knowledge of the soul. Next is realised knowledge of God, who rises from the bosom of the soul. This is the end of progress; differentiation between self and others has ceased. All the world of thought and senses is melted into an ocean without waves or current. This dissolution of the world is also known as the death of the sinful or worldly \\'I,\\' which veils the true Ego. Then the formless Being of the Deity is seen in the regions of pure consciousness beyond the veil of thought. Consciousness is wholly distinct from thought and senses; it knows them; they do not know it. The only proof is an appeal to spiritual experience.\" In the highest stage one is absolutely inert, \"knowing nothing in particular.[176]\"',\n",
       " 'The three stages of the mystic\\'s ascent appear in Tauler\\'s sermons. We have first to practise self-control, till all our lower powers are governed by our highest reason. \"Jesus cannot speak in the temple of thy soul till those that sold and bought therein are cast out of it.\" In this stage we must be under strict rule and discipline. \"The old man must be subject to the old law, till Christ be born in him of a truth.\" Of the second stage he says, \"Wilt thou with St. John rest on the loving breast of our Lord Jesus Christ, thou must be transformed into His beauteous image by a constant, earnest contemplation thereof.\" It is possible that God may will to call thee higher still; then let go all forms and images, and suffer Him to work with thee as His instrument. To some the very door of heaven has been opened--\"this happens to some with a convulsion of the mind, to others calmly and gradually.\" \"It is not the work of a day nor of a year.\" \"Before it can come to pass, nature must endure many a death, outward and inward.\"',\n",

But we must pass through darkness to go from one to the other. \"The darker the night is, the nearer is the true day.\" This is the \"darkness\" and \"nothing\" spoken of by the mystics, \"a rich nothing,\" when the soul is \"at rest as to thoughts of any earthly thing, but very busy about thinking of God.\" \"But the night passeth away; the day dawneth.\" \"Flashes of light shine through the chinks of the walls of Jerusalem; but thou art not there yet.\" \"But now beware of the midday fiend, that feigneth light as if it came from Jerusalem. This light appears between two black rainy clouds, whereof the upper one is presumption and self-exaltation, and the lower a disdaining of one\\'s neighbour.

       " 'The truth is that there are two movements,--a systole and diastole of the spiritual life,--an expansion and a concentration. The tendency has generally been to emphasise one at the expense of the other; but they must work together, for each is helpless without the other. As Shakespeare says[46]--',\n",
       " 'The turbid streams of theurgy and magic flowed into the broad river of Christian thought by two channels--the later Neoplatonism, and Jewish Cabbalism. Of the former something has been said already. The root-idea of the system was that all life may be arranged in a descending scale of potencies, forming a kind of chain from heaven to earth. Man, as a microcosm, is in contact with every link in the chain, and can establish relations with all spiritual powers, from the superessential One to the lower spirits or \"dæmons.\" The philosopher-saint, who had explored the highest regions of the intelligence, might hope to dominate the spirits of the air, and compel them to do his bidding. Thus the door was thrown wide open for every kind of superstition. The Cabbalists followed much the same path. The word Cabbala means \"oral tradition,\" and is defined by Reuchlin as \"the symbolic reception of a Divine revelation handed down for the saving contemplation of God and separate forms.[338]\" In another place he says, \"The Cabbala is nothing else than symbolic theology, in which not only are letters and words symbols of things, but things are symbols of other things.\" This method of symbolic interpretation was held to have been originally communicated by revelation,[339] in order that persons of holy life might by it attain to a mystical communion with God, or deification. The Cabbalists thus held much the same relation to the Talmudists as the mystics to the scholastics in the twelfth century. But, as Jews, they remained faithful to the two doctrines of an inspired tradition and an inspired book, which distinguish them from Platonic mystics.[340]',\n",
       " 'The two chief works of St. Juan are The Ascent of Mount Carmel, and The Obscure Night of the Soul. Both are treatises on quietistic Mysticism of a peculiar type. At the beginning of La Subida de Monte Carmelo he says, \"The journey of the soul to the Divine union is called night for three reasons: the point of departure is privation of all desire, and complete detachment from the world; the road is by faith, which is like night to the intellect; the goal, which is God, is incomprehensible while we are in this life.\"',\n",
       " 'The two great sacraments are typical symbols, if we use the word in the sense which I give to it, as something which, in being what it is, is a sign and vehicle of something higher and better. This is what the early Church meant when it called the sacraments symbols.[324] A \"symbol\" at that period implied a mystery, and a \"mystery\" implied a revelation. The need of sacraments is one of the deepest convictions of the religious consciousness. It rests ultimately on the instinctive reluctance to allow any spiritual fact to remain without an external expression. It is obvious that all morality depends on the application of this principle to conduct. All voluntary external acts are symbolic of (that is, vitally connected with) internal states, and cannot be divested of this their essential character. It may be impossible to show how an act of the material body can purify or defile the immaterial spirit; but the correspondence between the outward and inward life cannot be denied without divesting morality of all meaning. The maxim of Plotinus, that \"the mind can do no wrong,\" when transferred from his transcendental philosophy to matters of conduct, is a sophism no more respectable than that which Euripides puts into the mouth of one of his characters: \"The tongue hath sworn; the heart remains unsworn.\" Every act of the will is the expression of a state of the soul; and every state of the soul must seek to find expression in an act of the will. Love, as we should all admit, is not love, so long as it is content to be only in thought, or \"in word and in tongue\"; it is only when it is love \"in deed\" that it is love \"in truth.[325]\" And it is the same with all other virtues, which are in this sense symbolic, as implying something beyond the external act. Nearly all the states or motions of the soul can find their appropriate expression in action. Charity in its manifold forms need not seek long for an object; and thankfulness and penitence, though they drive us first to silent prayer, are not satisfied till they have borne fruit in some act of gratitude or humility. But that deepest sense of communion with God, which is the very heart of religion, is in danger of being shut up in thought and word, which are inadequate expressions of any spiritual state. No doubt this highest state of the soul may find indirect expression in good works; but these fail to express the immediacy of the communion which the soul has felt. The want of symbols to express these highest states of the soul is supplied by sacraments. A sacrament is a symbolic act, not arbitrarily chosen, but resting, to the mind of the recipient, on Divine authority, which has no ulterior object except to give expression to, and in so doing to effectuate,[326] a relation which is too purely spiritual to find utterance in the customary activities of life. There are three requisites (on the human side) for the validity of a sacramental act. The symbol must be appropriate; the thing symbolised must be a spiritual truth; and there must be the intention to perform the act as a sacrament.',\n",
       " 'The universe is the expression of the whole thought of the Father; it is the language of the Word. Eckhart loves startling phrases, and says boldly, \"Nature is the lower part of the Godhead,\" and \"Before creation, God was not God.\" These statements are not so crudely pantheistic as they sound. He argues that without the Son the Father would not be God, but only undeveloped potentiality of being. The three Persons are not merely accidents and modes of the Divine Substance, but are inherent in the Godhead.[239] And so there can never have been a time when the Son was not. But the generation of the Son necessarily involves the creation of an ideal world; for the Son is Reason, and Reason is constituted by a cosmos of ideas. When Eckhart speaks of creation and of the world which had no beginning, he means, not the world of phenomena, but the world of ideas, in the Platonic sense. The ideal world is the complete expression of the thought of God, and is above space and time. He calls it \"non-natured nature,\" as opposed to \"diu genâ-tûrte nâtûre,\" the world of phenomena.[240] Eckhart\\'s doctrine here differs from that of Plotinus in a very important particular. The Neoplatonists always thought of emanation as a diffusion of rays from a sun, which necessarily decrease in heat and brightness as they recede from the central focus. It follows that the second Person of the Trinity, the [Greek: Nous] or Intelligence, is subordinate to the First, and the Third to the Second. But with Eckhart there is no subordination. The Son is the pure brightness of the Father\\'s glory, and the express image of His Person. \"The eternal fountain of things is the Father; the image of things in Him is the Son, and love for this Image is the Holy Ghost.\" All created things abide \"formless\" (as possibilities) in the ground of the Godhead, and all are realised in the Son. The Alexandrian Fathers, in identifying the Logos with the Platonic [Greek: Nous], the bearer of the World-Idea, had found it difficult to avoid subordinating Him to the Father. Eckhart escapes this heresy, but in consequence his view of the world is more pantheistic. For his intelligible world is really God--it is the whole content of the Divine mind.[241] The question has been much debated, whether Eckhart really falls into pantheism or not. The answer seems to me to depend on what is the obscurest part of his whole system--the relation of the phenomenal world to the world of ideas. He offers the Christian dogma of the Incarnation of the Logos as a kind of explanation of the passage of the \"prototypes\" into \"externality.\" When God \"speaks\" His ideas, the phenomenal world arises. This is an incarnation. But the process by which the soul emancipates itself from the phenomenal and returns to the intelligible world, is also called a \"begetting of the Son.\" Thus the whole process is a circular one--from God and back to God again. Time and space, he says, were created with the world. Material things are outside each other, spiritual things in each other. But these statements do not make it clear how Eckhart accounts for the imperfections of the phenomenal world, which he is precluded from explaining, as the Neoplatonists did, by a theory of emanation. Nor can we solve the difficulty by importing modern theories of evolution into his system. The idea of the world-history as a gradual realisation of the Divine Personality was foreign to Eckhart\\'s thought. Stöckl, indeed, tries to father upon him the doctrine that the human mind is a necessary organ of the self-development of God. But this theory cannot be found in Eckhart. The \"necessity\" which impels God to \"beget His Son\" is not a physical but a moral necessity. \"The good must needs impart itself,\" he says.[242] The fact is that his view of the world is much nearer to acosmism than to pantheism. \"Nothing hinders us so much from the knowledge of God as time and place,\" he says. He sees in phenomena only the negation of being, and it is not clear how he can also regard them as the abode of the immanent God.[243] It would probably be true to say that, like most mediæval thinkers, he did not feel himself obliged to give a permanent value to the transitory, and that the world, except as the temporary abode of immortal spirits, interested him but little. His neglect of history, including the earthly life of Christ, is not at all the result of scepticism about the miraculous. It is simply due to the feeling that the Divine process in the \"everlasting Now\" is a fact of immeasurably greater importance than any occurrence in the external world can be.',\n",
       " 'The universe resembles a vast chain, of which every being is a link. It may also be compared to rays of light shed abroad from one centre. Everything flowed from this centre, and everything desires to flow back towards it. God draws all men and all things towards Himself as a magnet draws iron, with a constant unvarying attraction. This theory of emanation is often sharply contrasted with that of evolution, and is supposed to be discredited by modern science; but that is only true if the emanation is regarded as a process in time, which for the Neoplatonist it is not.[133] In fact, Plotinus uses the word \"evolution\" to explain the process of nature.[134]',\n",
       " 'The way in which Hilton conceives the \"truly mystical darkness\" of Dionysius is very interesting. As a psychical experience, it has its place in the history of the inner life. The soul does enter into darkness, and the darkness is not fully dispelled in this world; \"thou art not there yet,\" as he says. But the psychical experience is in Hilton entirely dissociated from the metaphysical idea of absorption into the Infinite. The chains of Asiatic nihilism are now at last shaken off, easily and, it would seem, unconsciously. The \"darkness\" is felt to be only the herald of a brighter dawn: \"the darker the night, the nearer is the true day.\" It is, I think, gratifying to observe how our countryman strikes off the fetters of the time-honoured Dionysian tradition, the paralysing creed which blurs all distinctions, and the \"negative road\" which leads to darkness and not light; and how in consequence his Mysticism is sounder and saner than even that of Eckhart or Tauler. Before leaving Hilton, it may be worth while to quote two or three isolated maxims of his, as examples of his wise and pure doctrine.',\n",
       " 'The whole universe is one vast organism,[135] and if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it.[136] This is why a \"faint movement of sympathy[137]\" stirs within us at the sight of any living creature. So Origen says, \"As our body, while consisting of many members, is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be thought of as an immense living being, which is held together by one soul--the power and the Logos of God.\" All existence is drawn upwards towards God by a kind of centripetal attraction, which is unconscious in the lower, half conscious in the higher organisms.',\n",
       " 'The word \"Logos\" does not occur in any of the discourses. The identification of Christ with the \"Word\" or \"Reason\" of the philosophers is St. John\\'s own. But the statements in the prologue are all confirmed by our Lord\\'s own words as reported by the evangelist. These fall under two heads, those which deal with the relation of Christ to the Father, and those which deal with His relation to the world. The pre-existence of Christ in glory at the right hand of God is proved by several declarations: \"What if ye shall see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?\" \"And now, O Father, glorify Me with Thine own self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.\" His exaltation above time is shown by the solemn statement, \"Before Abraham was, I am.\" And with regard to the world, we find in St. John the very important doctrine, which has never made its way into popular theology, that the Word is not merely the Instrument in the original creation,--\"by (or through) Him all things were made,\"--but the central Life, the Being in whom life existed and exists as an indestructible attribute, an underived prerogative,[60] the Mind or Wisdom who upholds and animates the universe without being lost in it. This doctrine, which is implied in other parts of St. John, seems to be stated explicitly in the prologue, though the words have been otherwise interpreted. \"That which has come into existence,\" says St. John, \"was in Him life\" ([Greek: ho gegonen, en autô zôê ên.]) That is to say, the Word is the timeless Life, of which the temporal world is a manifestation. This doctrine was taught by many of the Greek Fathers, as well as by Scotus Erigena and other speculative mystics. Even if, with the school of Antioch and most of the later commentators, we transfer the words [Greek: ho gegonen] to the preceding sentence, the doctrine that Christ is the life as well as the light of the world can be proved from St. John.[61] The world is the poem of the Word to the glory of the Father: in it, and by means of it, He displays in time all the riches which God has eternally put within Him.',\n",

For instance, a French writer gives as his definition of Mysticism \"the tendency to approach the Absolute, morally, by means of symbols.[318]\" On the other hand, an English essayist denies that Mysticism is symbolic.[319] Mysticism, he says, differs from symbolism in that, while symbolism treats the connexion between symbol and substance as something accidental or subjective, Mysticism is based on a positive belief in the existence of life within life, of deep correspondences and affinities, not less real than those to which the common superficial consciousness of mankind bears witness. I agree with this statement about the basis of Mysticism, but I prefer to use the word symbol of that which has a real, and not merely a conventional affinity to the thing symbolised.[320] The line is by no means easy to draw. An aureole is not, properly speaking, a symbol of saintliness,[321] nor a crown of royal authority, because in these instances the connexion of sign with significance is conventional. A circle is perhaps not a symbol of eternity, because the comparison appeals only to the intellect. But falling leaves are a symbol of human mortality, a flowing river of the \"stream\" of life, and a vine and its branches of the unity of Christ and the Church, because they are examples of the same law which operates through all that God has made. And when the Anglian noble, in a well-known passage of Bede, compares the life of man to the flight of a bird which darts quickly through a lighted hall out of darkness, and into darkness again, he has found a symbol which is none the less valid, because light and darkness are themselves only symbolically connected with life and death. The writer who denies that Mysticism is symbolic, means that the discovery of arbitrary and fanciful resemblances or types is no part of healthy Mysticism.[322] In this he is quite right; and the importance of the distinction which he wishes to emphasise will, I hope, become clear as we proceed. It is not possible always to say dogmatically, \"This is genuine Symbolism, and that is morbid or fantastic\"; but we do assert that there is a true and a false Symbolism, of which the true is not merely a legitimate, but a necessary mode of intuition; while the latter is at best a frivolous amusement, and at worst a degrading superstition.[323]',\n",
       " 'The world as it is, is the world as God sees it, not as we see it. Our vision is distorted, not so much by the limitations of finitude, as by sin and ignorance. The more we can raise ourselves in the scale of being, the more will our ideas about God and the world correspond to the reality. \"Such as men themselves are, such will God Himself seem to them to be,\" says John Smith, the English Platonist. Origen, too, says that those whom Judas led to seize Jesus did not know who He was, for the darkness of their own souls was projected on His features.[38] And Dante, in a very beautiful passage, says that he felt that he was rising into a higher circle, because he saw Beatrice\\'s face becoming more beautiful.[39]',\n",
       " 'The world is an image of the Divine Mind, which is itself a reflection of the One. It is therefore not bad or evil. \"What more beautiful image of the Divine could there be,\" he asks, \"than this world, except the world yonder?\" And so it is a great mistake to shut our eyes to the world around us, \"and all beautiful things.[132]\" The love of beauty will lead us up a long way--up to the point when the love of the Good is ready to receive us. Only we must not let ourselves be entangled by sensuous beauty. Those who do not quickly rise beyond this first stage, to contemplate \"ideal form, the universal mould,\" share the fate of Hylas; they are engulfed in a swamp, from which they never emerge.',\n",
       " 'Theosophical and magical Mysticism culminated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Just as the idealism of Plotinus lost itself in the theurgic system of Iamblichus, so the doctrine of Divine immanence preached by Eckhart and his school was followed by the Nature-Mysticism of Cornelius Agrippa[346] and Paracelsus.[347] The \"negative road\" had been discredited by Luther\\'s invective, and Mysticism, instead of shutting her eyes to the world of phenomena, stretched forth her hands to conquer and annex it. The old theory of a World-Spirit, the pulsations of whose heart are felt in all the life of the universe, came once more into favour. Through all phenomena, it was believed, runs an intricate network of sympathies and antipathies, the threads of which, could they be disentangled, would furnish us with a clue through all the labyrinths of natural and supernatural science. The age was impatient to enter on the inheritance from which humanity had long been debarred; the methods of experimental science seemed tame and slow; and so we find, especially in Germany, an extraordinary outburst of Nature-Mysticism-- astrology, white magic, alchemy, necromancy, and what not--such as Christianity had not witnessed before. These pseudo-sciences (with which was mingled much real progress in medicine, natural history, and kindred sciences) were divided under three provinces or \"vincula\"--those of the Spiritual World, which were mainly magical invocations, diagrams, and signs; those of the Celestial World, which were taught by astrology; and those of the Elemental World, which consisted in the sympathetic influence of material objects upon each other. These secrets (it was held) are all discoverable by man; for man is a microcosm, or epitome of the universe, and there is nothing in it with which he cannot claim an affinity. In knowing himself, he knows both God and all the other works that God has made.',\n",
       " 'There are many, I fear, to whom \"the mystical element in the Old Testament\" will suggest only the Cabbalistic lore of types and allegories which has been applied to all the canonical books, and with especial persistency and boldness to the Song of Solomon. I shall give my opinion upon this class of allegorism in the seventh Lecture of this course, which will deal with symbolism as a branch of Mysticism. It would be impossible to treat of it here without anticipating my discussion of a principle which has a much wider bearing than as a method of biblical exegesis. As to the Song of Solomon, its influence upon Christian Mysticism has been simply deplorable. A graceful romance in honour of true love was distorted into a precedent and sanction for giving way to hysterical emotions, in which sexual imagery was freely used to symbolise the relation between the soul and its Lord. Such aberrations are as alien to sane Mysticism as they are to sane exegesis.[59]',\n",
       " 'There are other religious forms for which no Divine institution is claimed, but which have a quasi-sacramental value. And those who, \"whether they eat, or drink, or whatever they do,\" do all to the glory of God, may be said to turn the commonest acts into sacraments. To the true mystic, life itself is a sacrament. It is natural, but unfortunate, that some of those who have felt this most strongly have shown a tendency to disparage observances which are simply acts of devotion, \"mere forms,\" as they call them. The attempt to distinguish between conventional ceremonies, which have no essential connexion with the truth symbolised, and actions which are in themselves moral or immoral, is no doubt justifiable, but it should be remembered that this is the way in which antinomianism takes its rise. Many have begun by saying, \"The heart, the motive, is all, the external act nothing; the spirit is all, the letter nothing. What can it matter whether I say my prayers in church or at home, on my knees or in bed, in words or in thought only? What can it matter whether the Eucharistic bread and wine are consecrated or not? whether I actually eat and drink or not?\" And so on. The descent to Avernus is easy by this road. Perhaps no sect that has professed contempt for all ceremonial forms has escaped at least the imputation of scandalous licentiousness, with the honourable exception of the Quakers. The truth is that the need of symbols to express or represent our highest emotions is inwoven with human nature, and indifference to them is not, as many have supposed, a sign of enlightenment or of spirituality. It is, in fact, an unhealthy symptom. We do not credit a man with a warm heart who does not care to show his love in word and act; nor should we commend the common sense of a soldier who saw in his regimental colours only a rag at the end of a pole. It is one of the points in which we must be content to be children, and should be thankful that we may remain children with a clear conscience.',\n",
       " 'There are three notable expressions about God the Father in the Gospel and First Epistle of St. John: \"God is Love\"; \"God is Light\"; and \"God is Spirit.\" The form of the sentences teaches us that these three qualities belong so intimately to the nature of God that they usher us into His immediate presence. We need not try to get behind them, or to rise above them into some more nebulous region in our search for the Absolute. Love, Light, and Spirit are for us names of God Himself. And observe that St. John does not, in applying these semi-abstract words to God, attenuate in the slightest degree His personality. God is Love, but He also exercises love. \"God so loved the world.\" And He is not only the \"white radiance\" that \"for ever shines\"; He can \"draw\" us to Himself, and \"send\" His Son to bring us back to Him.',\n",
       " 'There are two lives, the active and the contemplative, but in the latter there are many stages. The highest state of contemplation a man cannot enjoy always, \"but only by times, when he is visited\"; \"and, as I gather from the writings of holy men, the time of it is very short.\" \"This part of contemplation God giveth where He will.\" Visions and revelations, of whatever kind, \"are not true contemplation, but merely secondary. The devil may counterfeit them\"; and the only safeguard against these impostures is to consider whether the visions have helped or hindered us in devotion to God, humility, and other virtues.',\n",
       " 'There are two other views of the universe which have been called pantheistic, but incorrectly.',\n",
       " 'There are two views of this sacrament which the \"plain man\" has always found much easier to understand than the symbolic view which is that of our Church. One is that it is a miracle or magical performance, the other is that it is a mere commemoration. Both are absolutely destructive of the idea of a sacrament. The latter view, that of some Protestant sects, was quite foreign to the early Church, so far as our evidence goes; the former, it is only just to say, is found in many of the Fathers, not in the grossly materialistic form which it afterwards assumed, but in such phrases as \"the medicine of immortality\" applied to the consecrated elements, where we are meant to understand that the elements have a mysterious power of preserving the receiver from the natural consequences of death.[328] But when we find that the same writers who use compromising phrases about the change that comes over the elements,[329] also use the language of symbolism, and remember, too, that a \"miracle\" was a very different thing to those who knew of no inflexible laws in the natural world from what it is to us, we shall not be ready to agree with those who have accused the third and fourth century Fathers of degrading the Lord\\'s Supper into a magical ceremony.',\n",
       " 'There can be no difficulty in classifying this Syrian philosophy of religion. It is the ancient religion of the Brahmins, masquerading in clothes borrowed from Jewish allegorists, half-Christian Gnostics, Manicheans, Platonising Christians, and pagan Neoplatonists. We will now see what St. Dionysius makes of this system, which he accepts as from the hand of one who has \"not only learned, but felt the things of God.[156]\"',\n",
       " 'There is another class of \"mystics\" with whom I have but little sympathy--the dabblers in occultism. \"Psychical research\" is, no doubt, a perfectly legitimate science; but when its professors invite us to watch the breaking down of the middle wall of partition between matter and spirit, they have, in my opinion, ceased to be scientific, and are in reality hankering after the beggarly elements of the later Neoplatonism.',\n",
       " 'There is another expression which must be considered in connexion with the mediæval doctrine of deification. This is the intellectus agens, or [Greek: nous poiêtikos], which began its long history in Aristotle (De Anima, iii. 5). Aristotle there distinguishes two forms of Reason, which are related to each other as form and matter. Reason becomes all things, for the matter of anything is potentially the whole class to which it belongs; but Reason also makes all things, that is to say, it communicates to things those categories by which they become objects of thought. This higher Reason is separate and impassible ([Greek: chôristos kai amigês kai apathês]); it is eternal and immortal; while the passive reason perishes with the body. The creative Reason is immanent both in the human mind and in the external world; and thus only is it possible for the mind to know things. Unfortunately, Aristotle says very little more about his [Greek: nous poiêtikos], and does not explain how the two Reasons are related to each other, thereby leaving the problem for his successors to work out. The most fruitful attempt to form a consistent theory, on an idealistic basis, out of the ambiguous and perhaps irreconcilable statements in the De Anima, was made by Alexander of Aphrodisias (about 200 A.D.), who taught that the Active Reason \"is not a part or faculty of our soul, but comes to us from without\"--it is, in fact, identified with the Spirit of God working in us. Whether Aristotle would have accepted this interpretation of his theory may be doubted; but the commentary of Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Arabic, and this view of the Active Reason became the basis of the philosophy of Averroes. Averroes teaches that it is possible for the passive reason to unite itself with the Active Reason, and that this union may be attained or prepared for by ascetic purification and study. But he denies that the passive reason is perishable, not wishing entirely to depersonalise man. Herein he follows, he says, Themistius, whose views he tries to combine with those of Alexander. Avicenna introduces a celestial hierarchy, in which the higher intelligences shed their light upon the lower, till they reach the Active Reason, which lies nearest to man, \"a quo, ut ipse dicit, effluunt species intelligibiles in animas nostras\" (Aquinas). The doctrine of \"monopsychism\" was, of course, condemned by the Church. Aquinas makes both the Active and Passive Reason parts of the human soul. Eckhart, as I have said in the fourth Lecture, at one period of his teaching expressly identifies the \"intellectus agens\" with the \"spark,\" in reference to which he says that \"here God\\'s ground is my ground, and my ground God\\'s ground.\" This doctrine of the Divinity of the ground of the soul is very like the Cabbalistic doctrine of the Neschamah, and the Neoplatonic doctrine of [Greek: Nous] (cf. Stöckl, vol. ii. p. 1007). Eckhart was condemned for saying, \"aliquid est in anima quod est increatum et increabile; si tota anima esset talis, esset increata et increabilis. Hoc est intellectus.\" Eckhart certainly says explicitly that \"as fire turns all that it touches into itself, so the birth of the Son of God in the soul turns us into God, so that God no longer knows anything in us but His Son.\" Man thus becomes \"filius naturalis Dei,\" instead of only \"filius adoptivus.\" We have seen that Eckhart, towards the end of his life, inclined more and more to separate the spark, the organ of Divine contemplation, from the reason. This is, of course, an approximation to the other view of deification--that of substitution or miraculous infusion from without, unless we see in it a tendency to divorce the personality from the reason. Ruysbroek states his doctrine of the Divine spark very clearly: \"The unity of our spirit in God exists in two ways, essentially and actively. The essential existence of the soul, quæ secundum æternam ideam in Deo nos sumus, itemque quam in nobis habemus, medii ac discriminis expers est. Spiritus Deum in nuda natura essentialiter possidet, et spiritum Deus. Vivit namque in Deo et Deus in ipso; et secundum supremam sui partem Dei claritatem suscipere absque medio idoneus est; quin etiam per æterni exemplaris sui claritudinem essentialiter ac personaliter in ipso lucentis, secundum supremam vivacitatis suæ portionem, in divinam sese demittit ac demergit essentiam, ibidemque perseveranter secundum ideam manendo æternam suam possidet beatitudinem; rursusque cum creaturis omnibus per æternam Verbi generationem inde emanans, in esse suo creato constituitur.\" The \"natural union,\" though it is the first cause of all holiness and blessedness, does not make us holy and blessed, being common to good and bad alike. \"Similitude\" to God is the work of grace, \"quæ lux quædam deiformis est.\" We cannot lose the \"unitas,\" but we can lose the \"similitudo quæ est gratia.\" The highest part of the soul is capable of receiving a perfect and immediate impression of the Divine essence; by this \"apex mentis\" we may \"sink into the Divine essence, and by a new (continuous) creation return to our created being according to the idea of God.\" The question whether the \"ground of the soul\" is created or not is obviously a form of the question which we are now discussing. Giseler, as I have said, holds that it was created with the soul. Sterngassen says: \"That which God has in eternity in uncreated wise, that has the soul in time in created wise.\" But the author of the Treatise on Love, which belongs to this period, speaks of the spark as \"the Active Reason, which is God.\" And again, \"This is the Uncreated in the soul of which Master Eckhart speaks.\" Suso seems to imply that he believed the ground of the soul to be uncreated, an emanation of the Divine nature; and Tauler uses similar language. Ruysbroek, in the last chapter of the Spiritual Nuptials, says that contemplative men \"see that they are the same simple ground as to their uncreated nature, and are one with the same light by which they see, and which they see.\" The later German mystics taught that the Divine essence is the material substratum of the world, the creative will of God having, so to speak, alienated for the purpose a portion of His own essence. If, then, the created form is broken through, God Himself becomes the ground of the soul. Even Augustine countenances some such notion when he says, \"From a good man, or from a good angel, take away \\'man\\' or \\'angel,\\' and you find God.\" But one of the chief differences between the older and later Mysticism is that the former regarded union with God as achieved through the faculties of the soul, the latter as inherent in its essence. The doctrine of immanence, more and more emphasised, tended to encourage the belief that the Divine element in the soul is not merely something potential, something which the faculties may acquire, but is immanent and basal. Tauler mentions both views, and prefers the latter. Some hesitation may be traced in the Theologia Germanica on this point (p. 109, \"Golden Treasury\" edition): \"The true light is that eternal Light which is God; or else it is a created light, but yet Divine, which is called grace.\" Our Cambridge Platonists naturally revived this Platonic doctrine of deification, much to the dissatisfaction of some of their contemporaries. Tuckney speaks of their teaching as \"a kind of moral divinity minted only with a little tincture of Christ added. Nay, a Platonic faith unites to God!\" Notwithstanding such protests, the Platonists persisted that all true happiness consists in a participation of God; and that \"we cannot enjoy God by any external conjunction with Him.\"',\n",
       " 'There is another feature in St. John\\'s Gospel which shows his affinity to Mysticism, though of a different kind from that which we have been considering. I mean his fondness for using visible things and events as symbols. This objective kind of Mysticism will form the subject of my last two Lectures, and I will here only anticipate so far as to say that the belief which underlies it is that \"everything, in being what it is, is symbolic of something more.\" The Fourth Gospel is steeped in symbolism of this kind. The eight miracles which St. John selects are obviously chosen for their symbolic value; indeed, he seems to regard them mainly as acted parables. His favourite word for miracles is [Greek: sêmeia], \"signs\" or \"symbols.\" It is true that he also calls them \"works,\" but this is not to distinguish them as supernatural. All Christ\\'s actions are \"works,\" as parts of His one \"work.\" As evidences of His Divinity, such \"works\" are inferior to His \"words,\" being symbolic and external. Only those who cannot believe on the evidence of the words and their echo in the heart, may strengthen their weak faith by the miracles. But \"blessed are they who have not seen, and yet have believed.\" And besides these \"signs,\" we have, in place of the Synoptic parables, a wealth of allegories, in which Christ is symbolised as the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the Door of the Sheep, the good Shepherd, the Way, and the true Vine. Wind and water are also made to play their part. Moreover, there is much unobtrusive symbolism in descriptive phrases, as when he says that Nicodemus came by night, that Judas went out into the night, and that blood and water flowed from our Lord\\'s side; and the washing of the disciples\\' feet was a symbolic act which the disciples were to understand hereafter. Thus all things in the world may remind us of Him who made them, and who is their sustaining life.',\n",
       " 'There is one more fundamental doctrine which we must not omit. Purification removes the obstacles to our union with God, but our guide on the upward path, the true hierophant of the mysteries of God, is love[10]. Love has been defined as \"interest in its highest power\";[11] while others have said that \"it is of the essence of love to be disinterested.\" The contradiction is merely a verbal one. The two definitions mark different starting-points, but the two \"ways of love\" should bring us to the same goal. The possibility of disinterested love, in the ordinary sense, ought never to have been called in question. \"Love is not love\" when it asks for a reward. Nor is the love of man to God any exception. He who tries to be holy in order to be happy will assuredly be neither. In the words of the Theologia Germanica, \"So long as a man seeketh his own highest good because it is his, he will never find it.\" The mystics here are unanimous, though some, like St. Bernard, doubt whether perfect love of God can ever be attained, pure and without alloy, while we are in this life.[12] The controversy between Fénelon and Bossuet on this subject is well known, and few will deny that Fénelon was mainly in the right. Certainly he had an easy task in justifying his statements from the writings of the saints. But we need not trouble ourselves with the \"mystic paradox,\" that it would be better to be with Christ in hell than without Him in heaven--a statement which Thomas à Kempis once wrote and then erased in his manuscript. For wherever Christ is, there is heaven: nor should we regard eternal happiness as anything distinct from \"a true conjunction of the mind with God.[13]\" \"God is not without or above law: He could not make men either sinful or miserable.[14]\" To believe otherwise is to suppose an irrational universe, the one thing which a rational man cannot believe in.',\n",
       " 'There is one other point on which I wish to make my position clear. The fact that human love or sympathy is the guide who conducts us to the heart of life, revealing to us God and Nature and ourselves, is proof that part of our life is bound up with the life of the world, and that if we live in these our true relations we shall not entirely die so long as human beings remain alive upon this earth. The progress of the race, the diminution of sin and misery, the advancing kingdom of Christ on earth,--these are matters in which we have a personal interest. The strong desire that we feel--and the best of us feel it most strongly--that the human race may be better, wiser, and happier in the future than they are now or have been in the past, is neither due to a false association of ideas, nor to pure unselfishness. There is a sense in which death would not be the end of everything for us, even though in this life only we had hope in Christ.',\n",
       " 'There is something heroic in this sombre interpretation of the maxim of our Lord, \"Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple.\" All that he hath--\"yea, and his own life also\"--intellect, reason, and memory--all that is most Divine in our nature--are cast down in absolute surrender at the feet of Him who \"made darkness His secret place, His pavilion round about Him with dark water, and thick clouds to cover Him.[299]\"',\n",
       " 'These charges, then, do not seem to form a grave indictment against the type of Mysticism of which Wordsworth is the best representative. But he does fall short of the ideal held up by St. John for the Christian mystic, in that his love and sympathy for inanimate Nature were (at any rate in his poetry) deeper than for humanity. And if there is any accusation which may justly be brought against the higher order of mystics (as opposed to representatives of aberrant types), I think it is this: that they have sought and found God in their own souls and in Nature, but not so often in the souls of other men and women: theirs has been a lonely religion. The grand old maxim, \"Vides fratrem, vides Dominum tuum,\" has been remembered by them only in acts of charity. But in reality the love of human beings must be the shortest road to the vision of God. Love, as St. John teaches us, is the great hierophant of the Christian mysteries. It gives wings to contemplation and lightens the darkness which hides the face of God. When our emotions are deeply stirred, even Nature speaks to us with voices unheard before; while the man who is without human affection is either quite unmoved by her influences, or misreads all her lessons.',\n",
       " 'These considerations may well have a calming and reassuring influence upon those who, from whatever cause, are troubled by religious doubts. The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth, and is known by, them that are His. But we must not expect that \"religious difficulties\" will ever cease. Every truth that we know is but the husk of a deeper truth; and it may be that the Holy Spirit has still many things to say to us, which we cannot bear now. Each generation and each individual has his own problem, which has never been set in exactly the same form before: we must all work out our own salvation, for it is God who worketh in us. If we have realised the meaning of these words of St. Paul, which I have had occasion to quote so often in these Lectures, we cannot doubt that, though we now see through a glass darkly, and know only in part, we shall one day behold our Eternal Father face to face, and know Him even as we are known.',\n",
       " 'These different conceptions of the office of the Mysteries cannot, as I have said, be separated historically. They all reappear in the history of the Christian sacraments. The main features of the Mystery-system which passed into Catholicism are the notions of secrecy, of symbolism, of mystical brotherhood, of sacramental grace, and, above all, of the three stages in the spiritual life, ascetic purification, illumination, and [Greek: epopteia] as the crown.',\n",
       " 'These extracts from Harnack and Herrmann represent the attitude towards Mysticism of the Ritschlian school in Germany, of which Kaftan is another well-known exponent. They are neo-Kantians, whose religion is an austere moralism, and who seem to regard Christianity as a primitive Puritanism, spoiled by the Greeks, who brought into it their intellectualism and their sacramental mysteries. True Christianity, they say, is faith in the historic Christ. \"In the human Jesus,\" says Herrmann, \"we have met with a fact, the content of which is incomparably richer than that of any feelings which arise within ourselves,--a fact, moreover, which makes us so certain of God that, our reason and conscience being judges, our conviction is only confirmed that we are in communion with Him.\" \"The mystic\\'s experience of God is a delusion. If the Christian has learnt how Christ alone has lifted him above all that he had even been before, he cannot believe that another man might reach the same end by simply turning inward upon himself.\" \"The piety of the mystic is such that at the highest point to which it leads Christ must vanish from the soul along with all else that is external.\" This curious view of Christianity quite fails to explain how \"our reason and conscience\" can detect the \"incomparable richness\" of a revelation altogether unlike \"the feelings which arise within ourselves.\" It entirely ignores the Pauline and Johannine doctrine of the mystical union, according to which Christ is not \"external\" to the redeemed soul, and most assuredly can never \"vanish\" from it. Instead of the \"Lo I am with you alway\" of our blessed Lord, we are referred to \"history\"--that is, primarily, the four Gospels confirmed by \"a fifth,\" \"the united testimony of the first Christian community\" (Harnack, Christianity and History). We are presented with a Christianity without knowledge (Gnosis), without discipline, without sacraments, resting partly on a narrative which these very historical critics tear in pieces, each in his own fashion, and partly on a categorical imperative which is really the voice of \"irreligious moralism,\" as Pfleiderer calls it. The words are justified by such a sentence as this from Herrmann: \"Religious faith in God is, rightly understood, just the medium by which the universal law becomes individualised for the particular man in his particular place in the world\\'s life, so as to enable him to recognise its absoluteness as the ground of his self-certainty, and the ideal drawn in it as his own personal end.\" Thus the school which has shown the greatest animus against Mysticism unconsciously approaches very near to the atheism of Feuerbach. Indeed, what worse atheism can there be, than such disbelief in the rationality of our highest thoughts as is expressed in this sentence: \"Metaphysics is an impassioned endeavour to obtain recognition for thoughts, the contents of which have no other title to be recognised than their value for us\"? As if faith in God had any other meaning than a confidence that what is of \"value for us\" is the eternally and universally good and true! Herrmann\\'s attitude towards reason can only escape atheism by accepting in preference the crudest dualism, \"behind which\" (to quote Pfleiderer again) lies concealed simply \"the scepticism of a disintegrating Nominalism.\"',\n",
       " 'These extracts will show that the English Platonists breathe a larger air than the later Romish mystics, and teach a religion more definitely Christian than Erigena and Eckhart. I shall now show how this happy result was connected with a more truly spiritual view of the external world than we have met with in the earlier part of our survey. That the laws of nature are the laws of God, that \"man, as man, is averse to what is evil and wicked,\" that \"evil is unnatural,\" and a \"contradiction of the law of our being,\" which is only found in \"wicked men and devils,\" is one of Whichcote\\'s \"gallant themes.\" And Smith sets forth the true principles of Nature-Mysticism in a splendid passage, with which I will conclude this Lecture:--',\n",

They are followed by a period of extreme practical activity, when she devoted herself to organising communities of bare-footed Carmelites, whose austerity and devotion were to revive the glories of primitive Christianity. In this work she showed not only energy, but worldly wisdom and tact in no common degree. Her visions had certainly not impaired her powers as an organiser and ruler of men and women. Her labours continued without intermission till, at the age of sixty-seven, she was struck down by her last illness. \"This saint will be no longer wanted,\" she said, with a sparkle of her old vivacity, when she knew that she was to die.',\n",

It is, of course, true that for him, as for all mystics, Christ in us is more than Christ for us. But it is unfair to put it in this way, as if the German mystics wished to contrast the two views of redemption, and to exalt one at the expense of the other. Tauler\\'s wish is to give the historical redemption its true significance, by showing that it is an universal as well as a particular fact. When he says, \"We should worship Christ\\'s humanity only in union with this divinity,\" he is giving exactly the same caution which St. Paul expresses in the verse about \"knowing Christ after the flesh.\"',\n",

It is quite true that the nearer we approach to God, the wider seems to yawn the gulf that separates us from Him, till at last we feel it to be infinite. But does not this conviction itself bring with it unspeakable comfort? How could we be aware of that infinite distance, if there were not something within us which can span the infinite? How could we feel that God and man are incommensurable, if we had not the witness of a higher self immeasurably above our lower selves? And how blessed is the assurance that this higher self gives us access to a region where we may leave behind not only external troubles and \"the provoking of all men,\" but \"the strife of tongues\" in our own hearts, the chattering and growling of the \"ape and tiger\" within us, the recurring smart of old sins repented of, and the dragging weight of innate propensities! In this state the will, desiring nothing save to be conformed to the will of God, and separating itself entirely from all lower aims and wishes, claims the right of an immortal spirit to attach itself to eternal truth alone, having nothing in itself, and yet possessing all things in God. So Tauler says, \"Let a man lovingly cast all his thoughts and cares, and his sins too, as it were, on that unknown Will. O dear child! in the midst of all these enmities and dangers, sink thou into thy ground and nothingness. Let the tower with all its bells fall on thee; yea, let all the devils in hell storm out upon thee; let heaven and earth and all the creatures assail thee, all shall but marvellously serve thee; sink thou into thy nothingness, and the better part shall be thine.\" This hope of a real transformation of our nature by the free gift of God\\'s grace is the only message of comfort for those who are tied and bound by the chain of their sins.',\n",

       " 'This brief introduction will, I hope, have indicated the main characteristics of mystical theology and religion. It is a type which is as repulsive to some minds as it is attractive to others. Coleridge has said that everyone is born a Platonist or an Aristotelian, and one might perhaps adapt the epigram by saying that everyone is naturally either a mystic or a legalist. The classification does, indeed, seem to correspond to a deep difference in human characters; it is doubtful whether a man could be found anywhere whom one could trust to hold the scales evenly between--let us say--Fénelon and Bossuet. The cleavage is much the same as that which causes the eternal strife between tradition and illumination, between priest and prophet, which has produced the deepest tragedies in human history, and will probably continue to do so while the world lasts. The legalist--with his conception of God as the righteous Judge dispensing rewards and punishments, the \"Great Taskmaster\" in whose vineyard we are ordered to labour; of the Gospel as \"the new law,\" and of the sanction of duty as a \"categorical imperative\"--will never find it easy to sympathise with those whose favourite words are St. John\\'s triad--light, life, and love, and who find these the most suitable names to express what they know of the nature of God. But those to whom the Fourth Gospel is the brightest jewel in the Bible, and who can enter into the real spirit of St. Paul\\'s teaching, will, I hope, be able to take some interest in the historical development of ideas which in their Christian form are certainly built upon those parts of the New Testament.',\n",
       " 'This brings us to the third proposition--\"Without holiness no man may see the Lord\"; or, as it is expressed positively in the Sermon on the Mount, \"Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.\" Sensuality and selfishness are absolute disqualifications for knowing \"the things of the Spirit of God.\" These fundamental doctrines are very clearly laid down in the passage from St. John which I read as the text of this Lecture. The filial relation to God is already claimed, but the vision is inseparable from likeness to Him, which is a hope, not a possession, and is only to be won by \"purifying ourselves, even as He is pure.\"',\n",
       " 'This carefully-worded statement of the essence of Mysticism is followed by a hostile criticism. Professor Seth considers quietism the true conclusion from the mystic\\'s premisses. \"It is characteristic of Mysticism, that it does not distinguish between what is metaphorical and what is susceptible of a literal interpretation. Hence it is prone to treat a relation of ethical harmony as if it were one of substantial identity or chemical fusion; and, taking the sensuous language of religious feeling literally, it bids the individual aim at nothing less than an interpenetration of essence. And as this goal is unattainable while reason and the consciousness of self remain, the mystic begins to consider these as impediments to be thrown aside.... Hence Mysticism demands a faculty above reason, by which the subject shall be placed in immediate and complete union with the object of his desire, a union in which the consciousness of self has disappeared, and in which, therefore, subject and object are one.\" To this, I think, the mystic might answer: \"I know well that interpenetration and absorption are words which belong to the category of space, and are only metaphors or symbols of the relation of the soul to God; but separateness, impenetrability, and isolation, which you affirm of the ego, belong to the same category, and are no whit less metaphorical. The question is, which of the two sets of words best expresses the relation of the ransomed soul to its Redeemer? In my opinion, your phrase \\'ethical harmony\\' is altogether inadequate, while the New Testament expressions, \\'membership,\\' \\'union,\\' \\'indwelling,\\' are as adequate as words can be.\" The rest of the criticism is directed against the \"negative road,\" which I have no wish to defend, since I cannot admit that it follows logically from the first principles of Mysticism.',\n",
       " 'This criticism of the formless vision is excellent, but there is a palpable inconsistency between the definition of \"negative contemplation\" and the inclusion in it of \"all the attributes of God as distinct objects.\" Contradictions of this sort abound in Fénelon, and destroy the value of his writings as contributions to religious philosophy, though in his case, as in many others, we may speak of \"noble inconsistencies\" which do more credit to his heart than discredit to his intellect. We may perhaps see here the dying spasm of the \"negative method,\" which has crossed our path so often in this survey.',\n",
       " 'This definition, with which should be compared the passage from J.P. Ritcher, quoted in Lecture I., assumes that Mysticism may be treated as a branch of experimental psychology. Du Prel attaches great importance to somnambulism and other kindred psychical phenomena, which (he thinks) give us glimpses of the inner world of our Ego, in many ways different from our waking consciousness. \"As the moon turns to us only half its orb, so our Ego.\" He distinguishes between the Ego and the subject. The former will perish at death. It arises from the free act of the subject, which enters the time-process as a discipline. \"The self-conscious Ego is a projection of the transcendental subject, and resembles it.\" \"We should regard this earthly existence as a transitory phenomenal form in correspondence with our transcendental interest.\" \"Conscience is transcendental nature.\" (This last sentence suggests thoughts of great interest.) Du Prel shows how Schopenhauer\\'s pessimism may be made the basis of a higher optimism. \"The path of biological advance leads to the merging of the Ego in the subject.\" \"The biological aim for the race coincides with the transcendental aim for the individual.\" \"The whole content of Ethics is that the Ego must subserve the Subject.\" The disillusions of experience show that earthly life has no value for its own sake, and is only a means to an end; it follows that to make pleasure our end is the one fatal mistake in life. These thoughts are mixed with speculations of much less value; for I cannot agree with Du Prel that we shall learn much about higher and deeper modes of life by studying abnormal and pathological states of the consciousness.',\n",
       " 'This highest state, in which \"Reason dies in giving birth to Ecstasy, as Rachel died in giving birth to Benjamin,\" is not on the high road of the spiritual life. It is a rare gift, bestowed by supernatural grace. Richard says that the first stage of contemplation is an expansion of the soul, the second an exaltation, the third an alienation. The first arises from human effort, the second from human effort assisted by Divine grace, the third from Divine grace alone. The predisposing conditions for the third state are devotion (devotio), admiration (admiratio), and joy (exaltatio); but these cannot produce ecstasy, which is a purely supernatural infusion.',\n",
       " 'This notion grew within the Church as chiliastic and apocalyptic Christianity faded away. A favourite phrase was that the Incarnation, etc., \"abolished death,\" and brought mankind into a state of \"incorruption\" ([Greek: aphtharsia]) This transformation of human nature, which is also spoken of as [Greek: theopoiêsis] is the highest work of the Logos. Athanasius makes it clear that what he contemplates is no pantheistic merging of the personality in the Deity, but rather a renovation after the original type.',\n",
       " 'This passage of Isaiah bears a very close resemblance to the 15th and 24th Psalms; and there are many other psalms which have been dear to Christian mystics. In some of them we find the \"amoris desiderium\"--the thirst of the soul for God--which is the characteristic note of mystical devotion; in others, that longing for a safe refuge from the provoking of all men and the strife of tongues, which drove so many saints into the cloister. Many a solitary ascetic has prayed in the words of the 73rd Psalm: \"Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside Thee. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.\" And verses like, \"I will hearken what the Lord God will say concerning me,\" have been only too attractive to quietists. Other familiar verses will occur to most of us. I will only add that the warm faith and love which inspired these psalms is made more precious by the reverence for law which is part of the older inheritance of the Israelites.',\n",
       " 'This poor definition is the only one (except \"Mysticism is the romance of religion\") to be found in Hours with the Mystics, the solitary work in English which attempts to give a history of Christian Mysticism. The book has several conspicuous merits. The range of the author\\'s reading is remarkable, and he has a wonderful gift of illustration. But he was not content to trust to the interest of the subject to make his book popular, and tried to attract readers by placing it in a most incongruous setting. There is something almost offensive in telling the story of men like Tauler, Suso, and Juan of the Cross, in the form of smart conversations at a house-party, and the jokes cracked at the expense of the benighted \"mystics\" are not always in the best taste. Vaughan does not take his subject quite seriously enough. There is an irritating air of superiority in all his discussions of the lives and doctrines of the mystics, and his hatred and contempt for the Roman Church often warp his judgment. His own philosophical standpoint is by no means clear, and this makes his treatment of speculative Mysticism less satisfactory than the more popular parts of the book. It is also a pity that he has neglected the English representatives of Mysticism; they are quite as interesting in their way as Madame Guyon, whose story he tells at disproportionate length. At the same time, I wish to acknowledge considerable obligations to Vaughan, whose early death probably deprived us of even better work than the book which made his reputation.',\n",
       " 'This remarkable system anticipates the greater part of Christian and Pagan Neoplatonism. The astonishing thing is that Philo\\'s work exercised so little influence on the philosophy of the second century. It was probably regarded as an attempt to evolve Platonism out of the Pentateuch, and, as such, interesting only to the Jews, who were at this period becoming more and more unpopular.[115] The same prejudice may possibly have impaired the influence of Numenius, another semi-mystical thinker, who in the age of the Antonines evolved a kind of Trinity, consisting of God, whom he also calls Mind; the Son, the maker of the world, whom he does not call the Logos; and the world, the \"grandson,\" as he calls it. His Jewish affinities are shown by his calling Plato \"an Atticising Moses.\"',\n",
       " 'This sharp opposition between the natural and the supernatural, which is fully developed first by Richard of St. Victor, is the distinguishing feature of Catholic Mysticism. It is an abandonment of the great aim which the earlier Christian idealists had set before themselves, namely, to find spiritual law in the normal course of nature, and the motions of the Divine Word in the normal processes of mind. St. John\\'s great doctrine of the Logos as a cosmic principle is now dropped. Roman Catholic apologists[227] claim that Mysticism was thus set free from the \"idealistic pantheism\" of the Neoplatonist, and from the \"Gnostic-Manichean dualism\" which accompanies it. The world of space and time (they say) is no longer regarded, as it was by the Neoplatonist, as a fainter effluence from an ideal world, nor is human individuality endangered by theories of immanence. Both nature and man regain a sort of independence. We once more tread as free men on solid ground, while occasional \"supernatural phenomena\" are not wanting to testify to the existence of higher powers.',\n",
       " 'This tender reverence for Nature, which is a mark of all true Platonism, is found, as we have seen, in Plotinus. It is also prominent in the Platonists of the Renaissance, such as Bruno and Campanella,[368] and in Petrarch, who loved to offer his evening prayers among the moonlit mountains. Suso has at least one beautiful passage on the sights and sounds of spring, and exclaims, \"O tender God, if Thou art so loving in Thy creatures, how fair and lovely must Thou be in Thyself![369]\" The Reformers, especially Luther and Zwingli, are more alive than might have been expected to the value of Nature\\'s lessons; and the French mystics, Francis de Sales and Fénelon, write gracefully about the footprints of the Divine wisdom and beauty which may be traced everywhere in the world around us.',\n",
       " 'This view of reality, as a vista which is opened gradually to the eyes of the climber up the holy mount, is very near to the heart of Mysticism. It rests on the faith that the ideal not only ought to be, but is the real. It has been applied by some, notably by that earnest but fantastic thinker, James Hinton, as offering a solution of the problem of evil. We shall encounter attempts to deal with this great difficulty in several of the Christian mystics. The problem among the speculative writers was how to reconcile the Absolute of philosophy, who is above all distinctions,[40] with the God of religion, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. They could not allow that evil has a substantial existence apart from God, for fear of being entangled in an insoluble Dualism. But if evil is derived from God, how can God be good? We shall find that the prevailing view was that \"Evil has no substance.\" \"There is nothing,\" says Gregory of Nyssa, \"which falls outside of the Divine nature, except moral evil alone. And this, we may say paradoxically, has its being in not-being. For the genesis of moral evil is simply the privation of being.[41] That which, properly speaking, exists, is the nature of the good.\" The Divine nature, in other words, is that which excludes nothing, and contradicts nothing, except those attributes which are contrary to the nature of reality; it is that which harmonises everything except discord, which loves everything except hatred, verifies everything except falsehood, and beautifies everything except ugliness. Thus that which falls outside the notion of God, proves on examination to be not merely unreal, but unreality as such. But the relation of evil to the Absolute is not a religious problem. To our experience, evil exists as a positive force not subject to the law of God, though constantly overruled and made an instrument of good. On this subject we must say more later. Here I need only add that a sunny confidence in the ultimate triumph of good shines from the writings of most of the mystics, especially, I think, in our own countrymen. The Cambridge Platonists are all optimistic; and in the beautiful but little known Revelations of Juliana of Norwich, we find in page after page the refrain of \"All shall be well.\" \"Sin is behovable,[42] but all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.\"',\n",
       " 'Thus Eckhart is not content with the knowledge of God which is mediated by Christ, but aspires to penetrate into the \"Divine darkness\" which underlies the manifestation of the Trinity. In fact, when he speaks of the imitation of Christ, he distinguishes between \"the way of the manhood,\" which has to be followed by all, and \"the way of the Godhead,\" which is for the mystic only. In this overbold aspiration to rise \"from the Three to the One,\" he falls into the error which we have already noticed, and several passages in his writings advocate the quietistic self-simplification which belongs to this scheme of perfection. There are sentences in which he exhorts us to strip off all that comes to us from the senses, and to throw ourselves upon the heart of God, there to rest for ever, \"hidden from all creatures[251].\" But there are many other passages of an opposite tendency. He tells us that \"the way of the manhood,\" which, of course, includes imitation of the active life of Christ, must be trodden first by all; he insists that in the state of union the faculties of the soul will act in a new and higher way, so that the personality is restored, not destroyed; and, lastly, he teaches that contemplation is only the means to a higher activity, and that this is, in fact, its object; \"what a man has taken in by contemplation, that he pours out in love.\" There is no contradiction in the desire for rest combined with the desire for active service; for rest can only be defined as unimpeded activity; but in Eckhart there is, I think, a real inconsistency. The traditions of his philosophy pointed towards withdrawal from the world and from outward occupations--towards the monkish ideal, in a word; but the modern spirit was already astir within him. He preached in German to the general public, and his favourite themes are the present living operation of the Spirit, and the consecration of life in the world. There is, he shows, no contradiction between the active and the contemplative life; the former belongs to the faculties of the soul, the latter to its essence. In commenting on the story of Martha and Mary, those favourite types of activity and contemplation[252], he surprises us by putting Martha first. \"Mary hath chosen the good part; that is,\" he says, \"she is striving to be as holy as her sister. Mary is still at school: Martha has learnt her lesson. It is better to feed the hungry than to see even such visions as St. Paul saw.\" \"Besser ein Lebemeister als tausend Lesemeister.\" He discourages monkish religiosity and external badges of saintliness--\"avoid everything peculiar,\" he says, \"in dress, food, and language.\" \"You need not go into a desert and fast; a crowd is often more lonely than a wilderness, and small things harder to do than great.\" \"What is the good of the dead bones of saints?\" he asks, in the spirit of a sixteenth century reformer; \"the dead can neither give nor take[253].\" This double aspect of Eckhart\\'s teaching makes him particularly interesting; he seems to stand on the dividing-line between mediæval and modern Christianity.',\n",
       " 'Thus Weigel, who begins with Paracelsus, leaves off somewhere near Eckhart--and Eckhart in his boldest mood. But his chief concern is to attack the Bibliolaters (Buchstabentheologen) in the Lutheran Church, and to protest against the unethical dogma of imputed righteousness. We need not follow him into either of these controversies, which give a kind of accidental colouring to his theology. Speculative Mysticism, which is always the foe of formalism and dryness in religion, attacks them in whatever forms it finds them; and so, when we try to penetrate the essence of Mysticism by investigating its historical manifestations, we must always consider what was the system which in each case it was trying to purify and spiritualise. Weigel\\'s Mysticism moves in the atmosphere of Lutheran dogmatics. But it also marks a stage in the general development of Christian Mysticism, by giving a positive value to scientific and natural knowledge as part of the self-evolution of the human soul. \"Study nature,\" he says, \"physics, alchemy, magic, etc.; for it is all in you, and you become what you have learnt.\" It is true that his religious attitude is rigidly quietistic; but this position is so inconsistent with the activity which he enjoins on the \"reason,\" that he may claim the credit of having exhibited the contradiction between the positive and negative methods in a clear light; and to prove a contradiction is always the first step towards solving it.',\n",
       " 'To modern ears the word \"deification\" sounds not only strange, but arrogant and shocking. The Western consciousness has always tended to emphasise the distinctness of individuality, and has been suspicious of anything that looks like juggling with the rights of persons, human or Divine. This is especially true of thought in the Latin countries. Deus has never been a fluid concept like [Greek: theos]. St. Augustine no doubt gives us the current Alexandrian philosophy in a Latin dress; but this part of his Platonism never became acclimatised in the Latin-speaking countries. The Teutonic genius is in this matter more in sympathy with the Greek; but we are Westerns, while the later \"Greeks\" were half Orientals, and there is much in their habits of thought which is strange and unintelligible to us. Take, for instance, the apotheosis of the emperors. This was a genuinely Eastern mode of homage, which to the true European remained either profane or ridiculous. But Vespasian\\'s last joke, \"Voe! puto Deus fio!\" would not sound comic in Greek. The associations of the word [Greek: theos] were not sufficiently venerable to make the idea of deification ([Greek: theopoiêsis]) grotesque. We find, as we should expect, that this vulgarisation of the word affected even Christians in the Greek-speaking countries. Not only were the \"barbarous people\" of Galatia and Malta ready to find \"theophanies\" in the visits of apostles, or any other strangers who seemed to have unusual powers, but the philosophers (except the \"godless Epicureans\") agreed in calling the highest faculty of the soul Divine, and in speaking of \"the God who dwells within us.\" There is a remarkable passage of Origen (quoted by Harnack) which shows how elastic the word [Greek: theos] was in the current dialect of the educated. \"In another sense God is said to be an immortal, rational, moral Being. In this sense every gentle ([Greek: asteia]) soul is God. But God is otherwise defined as the self-existing immortal Being. In this sense the souls that are enclosed in wise men are not gods.\" Clement, too, speaks of the soul as \"training itself to be God.\" Even more remarkable than such language (of which many other examples might be given) is the frequently recurring accusation that bishops, teachers, martyrs, philosophers, etc., are venerated with Divine or semi-Divine honours. These charges are brought by Christians against pagans, by pagans against Christians, and by rival Christians against each other. Even the Epicureans habitually spoke of their founder Epicurus as \"a god.\" If we try to analyse the concept of [Greek: theos], thus loosely and widely used, we find that the prominent idea was that exemption from the doom of death was the prerogative of a Divine Being (cf. 1 Tim. vi. 16, \"Who only hath immortality\"), and that therefore the gift of immortality is itself a deification. This notion is distinctly adopted by several Christian writers. Theophilus says (ad Autol. ii. 27) \"that man, by keeping the commandments of God, may receive from him immortality as a reward ([Greek: misthon]), and become God.\" And Clement (Strom. v. 10. 63) says, \"To be imperishable ([Greek: to mê phtheiresthai]) is to share in Divinity.\" To the same effect Hippolytus (Philos. x. 34) says, \"Thy body shall be immortal and incorruptible as well as thy soul. For thou hast become God. All the things that follow upon the Divine nature God has promised to supply to thee, for thou wast deified in being born to immortality.\" With regard to later times, Harnack says that \"after Theophilus, Irenæus, Hippolytus, and Origen, the idea of deification is found in all the Fathers of the ancient Church, and that in a primary position. We have it in Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Apollinaris, Ephraem Syrus, Epiphanius, and others, as also in Cyril, Sophronius, and late Greek and Russian theologians. In proof of it, Ps. lxxxii. 6 (\\'I said, Ye are gods\\') is very often quoted.\" He quotes from Athanasius, \"He became man that we might be deified\"; and from Pseudo-Hippolytus, \"If, then, man has become immortal, he will be God.\"',\n",
       " 'True Pantheism must mean the identification of God with the totality of existence, the doctrine that the universe is the complete and only expression of the nature and life of God, who on this theory is only immanent and not transcendent. On this view, everything in the world belongs to the Being of God, who is manifested equally in everything. Whatever is real is perfect; reality and perfection are the same thing. Here again we must go to India for a perfect example. \"The learned behold God alike in the reverend Brahmin, in the ox and in the elephant, in the dog and in him who eateth the flesh of dogs.[181]\" So Pope says that God is \"as full, as perfect, in a hair as heart.\" The Persian Sufis were deeply involved in this error, which leads to all manner of absurdities and even immoralities. It is inconsistent with any belief in purpose, either in the whole or in the parts. Evil, therefore, cannot exist for the sake of a higher good: it must be itself good. It is easy to see how this view of the world may pass into pessimism or nihilism; for if everything is equally real and equally Divine, it makes no difference, except to our tempers, whether we call it everything or nothing, good or bad.',\n",
       " 'Very characteristic of the later Mysticism is the language which both Böhme and Law use about the future state. \"The soul, when it departs from the body,\" Böhme writes, \"needeth not to go far; for where the body dies, there is heaven and hell. God is there, and the devil; yea, each in his own kingdom. There also is Paradise; and the soul needeth only to enter through the deep door in the centre.\" Law is very emphatic in asserting that heaven and hell are states, not places, and that they are \"no foreign, separate, and imposed states, adjudged to us by the will of God.\" \"Damnation,\" he says, \"is the natural, essential state of our own disordered nature, which is impossible, in the nature of the thing, to be anything else but our own hell, both here and hereafter.\" \"There is nothing that is supernatural,\" he says very finely, \"in the whole system of our redemption. Every part of it has its ground in the workings and powers of nature, and all our redemption is only nature set right, or made to be that which it ought to be.[354] There is nothing that is supernatural but God alone.... Right and wrong, good and evil, true and false, happiness and misery, are as unchangeable in nature as time and space. Nothing, therefore, can be done to any creature supernaturally, or in a way that is without or contrary to the powers of nature; but every thing or creature that is to be helped, that is, to have any good done to it, or any evil taken out of it, can only have it done so far as the powers of nature are able, and rightly directed to effect it.[355]\"',\n",

He contemplated its beautiful little eyes, he kissed its tender little mouth, and he gazed again and again at all the infant members of the heavenly treasure. Then, lifting up his eyes, he uttered a cry of amazement that He who bears up the heavens is so great, and yet so small, so beautiful in heaven and so childlike on earth.

       " 'Von Hartmann\\'s hypostasis of the Unconscious has been often and justly criticised. But his chapter on Mysticism is of great value. He begins by asking, \"What is the Wesen of Mysticism?\" and shows that it is not quietism (disproved by mystics like Böhme, and by many active reformers), nor ecstasy (which is generally pathological), nor asceticism, nor allegorism, nor fantastic symbolism, nor obscurity of expression, nor religion generally, nor superstition, nor the sum of these things. It is healthy in itself, and has been of high value to individuals and to the race. It prepared for the Gospel of St. John, for the revolt against arid scholasticism in the Middle Ages, for the Reformation, and for modern German philosophy. He shows the mystical element in Hamann, Jacobi, Fichte, and Schelling; and quotes with approval the description of \"intellectual intuition\" given by the last named. We must not speak of thought as an antithesis to experience, \"for thought (including immediate or mystical knowledge) is itself experience.\" This knowledge is not derived from sense-perception,--the conscious will has nothing to do with it,--\"it can only have arisen through inspiration from the Unconscious.\" He would extend the name of mystic to \"eminent art-geniuses who owe their productions to inspirations of genius, and not to the work of their consciousness (e.g. Phidias, Æeschylus, Raphael, Beethoven)\", and even to every \"truly original\" philosopher, for every high thought has been first apprehended by the glance of genius. Moreover, the relation of the individual to the Absolute, an essential theme of philosophy, can only be mystically apprehended. \"This feeling is the content of Mysticism [Greek: kat exochên], because it finds its existence only in it.\" He then shows with great force how religious and philosophical systems have full probative force only for the few who are able to reproduce mystically in themselves their underlying suppositions, the truth of which can only be mystically apprehended. \"Hence it is that those systems which rejoice in most adherents are just the poorest of all and most unphilosophical (e.g. materialism and rationalistic Theism).\"',\n",

       " 'We are not now concerned with cosmological speculations, but the bearing of this theory on human personality is obvious. If the Son of God is regarded as an all-embracing and all-pervading cosmic principle, the \"mystic union\" of the believer with Christ becomes something much closer than an ethical harmony of two mutually exclusive wills. The question which exercises the mystics is not whether such a thing as fusion of personalities is possible, but whether, when the soul has attained union with its Lord, it is any longer conscious of a life distinct from that of the Word. We shall find that some of the best mystics went astray on this point. They teach a real substitution of the Divine for human nature, thus depersonalising man, and running into great danger of a perilous arrogance. The mistake is a fatal one even from the speculative side, for it is only on the analogy of human personality that we can conceive of the perfect personality of God; and without personality the universe falls to pieces. Personality is not only the strictest unity of which we have any experience; it is the fact which creates the postulate of unity on which all philosophy is based.',\n",

At one stage it is crucified, \"with the soul on the right and the body on the left\"; it is buried for three days; it descends into Hades;[154] then it ascends again, till it reaches Paradise, and is united to the tree of life: then it descends below all essences, and sees a formless luminous essence, and marvels that it is the same essence that it has seen on high. Now it comprehends the truth, that God is consubstantial with the Universe, and that there are no real distinctions anywhere. So it ceases to wander. \"All these doctrines,\" concludes the seer, \"which are unknown even to angels, have I disclosed to thee, my son\" (Dionysius, probably). \"Know, then, that all nature will be confused with the Father--that nothing will perish or be destroyed, but all will return, be sanctified, united, and confused.

       " 'We find in them most of the characteristic doctrines of Christian Neoplatonism: the radiation of all things from God and their return to God; the immanence of God in all things;[287] the notion of man as a microcosm, vitally connected with all the different orders of creation;[288] the Augustinian doctrine of Christ and His members as \"one Christ\";[289] insistence upon disinterested love;[290] and admonitions to close the eye of sense.[291] This last precept, which, as I have maintained, is neither true Platonism nor true Mysticism, must be set against others in which the universe is said to be a copy of the Divine Ideas, \"of which Plotinus has spoken divinely,\" the creation of Love, which has given form to chaos, and stamped it with the image of the Divine beauty; and in which we are exhorted to rise through the contemplation of nature to God.[292] Juan de Angelis, in his treatise on the spiritual nuptials, quotes freely, not only from Plato, Plotinus, and Virgil, but from Lucretius, Ovid, Tibullus, and Martial.',\n",
       " 'We have considered briefly the three stages of the mystic\\'s upward path. The scheme of life therein set forth was no doubt determined empirically, and there is nothing to prevent the simplest and most unlettered saint from framing his conduct on these principles. Many of the mediæval mystics had no taste for speculation or philosophy;[34] they accepted on authority the entire body of Church dogma, and devoted their whole attention to the perfecting of the spiritual life in the knowledge and love of God. But this cannot be said of the leaders. Christian Mysticism appears in history largely as an intellectual movement, the foster-child of Platonic idealism; and if ever, for a time, it forgot its early history, men were soon found to bring it back to \"its old loving nurse the Platonic philosophy.\" It will be my task, in the third and fourth Lectures of this course, to show how speculative Christian Mysticism grew out of Neoplatonism; but we shall not be allowed to forget the Platonists even in the later Lectures. \"The fire still burns on the altars of Plotinus,\" as Eunapius said.',\n",
       " 'We have seen how St. Paul speaks of a Gnosis or higher knowledge, which can be taught with safety only to the \"perfect\" or \"fully initiated\";[110] and he by no means rejects such expressions as the Pleroma (the totality of the Divine attributes), which were technical terms of speculative theism. St. John, too, in his prologue and other places, brings the Gospel into relation with current speculation, and interprets it in philosophical language. The movement known as Gnosticism, both within and without the Church, was an attempt to complete this reconciliation between speculative and revealed religion, by systematising the symbols of transcendental mystical theosophy.[111] The movement can only be understood as a premature and unsuccessful attempt to achieve what the school of Alexandria afterwards partially succeeded in doing. The anticipations of Neoplatonism among the Gnostics would probably be found to be very numerous, if the victorious party had thought their writings worth preserving. But Gnosticism was rotten before it was ripe. Dogma was still in such a fluid state, that there was nothing to keep speculation within bounds; and the Oriental element, with its insoluble dualism, its fantastic mythology and spiritualism, was too strong for the Hellenic. Gnosticism presents all the features which we shall find to be characteristic of degenerate Mysticism. Not to speak of its oscillations between fanatical austerities and scandalous licence, and its belief in magic and other absurdities, we seem, when we read Irenæus\\' description of a Valentinian heretic, to hear the voice of Luther venting his contempt upon some \"Geisterer\" of the sixteenth century, such as Carlstadt or Sebastian Frank. \"The fellow is so puffed up,\" says Irenæus, \"that he believes himself to be neither in heaven nor on earth, but to have entered within the Divine Pleroma, and to have embraced his guardian angel. On the strength of which he struts about as proud as a cock. These are the self-styled \\'spiritual persons,\\' who say they have already reached perfection.\" The later Platonism could not even graft itself upon any of these Gnostic systems, and Plotinus rejects them as decisively as Origen.',\n",
       " 'We have seen that the Logos-doctrine (as understood by St. Clement) is exceptionally liable to perversion; but the remedy of discarding it is worse than the disease. The unscriptural[228] and unphilosophical cleft between natural and supernatural introduces a more intractable dualism than that of Origen. The faculty which, according to this theory, possesses immediate intuition into the things of God is not only irresponsible to reason, but stands in no relation to it. It ushers us into an entirely new world, where the familiar criteria of truth and falsehood are inapplicable. And what it reveals to us is not a truer and deeper view of the actual, but a wholly independent cosmic principle which invades the world of experience as a disturbing force, spasmodically subverting the laws of nature in order to show its power over them.[229] For as soon as the formless intuition of contemplation begins to express itself in symbols, these symbols, when untested by reason, are transformed into hallucinations. The warning of Plotinus, that \"he who tries to rise above reason falls outside of it,\" receives a painful corroboration in such legends as that of St. Christina, who by reason of her extreme saintliness frequently soared over the tops of trees. The consideration of these alleged \"mystical phenomena\" belongs to objective Mysticism, which I hope to deal with in a later Lecture. Here I will only say that the scholastic-mystical doctrine of \"supernatural\" interventions, which at first sight seems so attractive, has led in practice to the most barbarous and ridiculous superstitions.[230]',\n",
       " \"We look in vain to Tauler for an explanation of the obscurest point in Eckhart's philosophy, as to the relations of the phenomenal to the real. We want clearer evidence that temporal existence is not regarded as something illusory or accidental, an error which may be inconsistent with the theory of immanence as taught by the school of Eckhart, but which is too closely allied with other parts of their scheme.\",\n",
       " \"We may also call pantheistic any system which regards the cosmic process as a real becoming of God. According to this theory, God comes to Himself, attains full self-consciousness, in the highest of His creatures, which are, as it were, the organs of His self-unfolding Personality. This is not a philosophy which commends itself specially to speculative mystics, because it involves the belief that time is an ultimate reality. If in the cosmic process, which takes place in time, God becomes something which He was not before, it cannot be said that He is exalted above time, or that a thousand years are to Him as one day. I shall say in my fourth Lecture that this view cannot justly be attributed to Eckhart. Students of Hegel are not agreed whether it is or is not part of their master's teaching.[183]\",\n",
       " 'We may arrive at the same conclusion by analysing that unconditioned sense of duty which we call conscience. This moral sense cannot be a fixed code implanted in our consciousness, for then we could not explain either the variations of moral opinion, or the feeling of obligation (as distinguished from necessity) which impels us to obey it. It cannot be the product of the existing moral code of society, for then we could not explain either the genesis of that public opinion or the persistent revolt against its limitations which we find in the greatest minds. The only hypothesis which explains the facts is that in conscience we feel the motions of the universal Reason which strives to convert the human organism into an organ of itself, a belief which is expressed in religious language by saying that it is God who worketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.',\n",
       " 'We may now return to the Christian Platonists. We find in Methodius the interesting doctrine that the indwelling Christ constantly repeats His passion in remembrance, \"for not otherwise could the Church continually conceive believers, and bear them anew through the bath of regeneration, unless Christ were repeatedly to die, emptying Himself for the sake of each individual.\" \"Christ must be born mentally ([Greek: moêtôs]) in every individual,\" and each individual saint, by participating in Christ, \"is born as a Christ.\" This is exactly the language of Eckhart and Tauler, and it is first clearly heard in the mouth of Methodius.[150] The new features are the great prominence given to immanence--the mystical union as an opus operatum, and the individualistic conception of the relation of Christ to the soul.',\n",
       " 'We must continue to co-operate with God\\'s grace, even in the highest stage, and not cease to resist our impulses, as if all came from God. \"To speak otherwise is to speak the language of the tempter.\" (This is, of course, directed against the immoral apathy attributed to Molinos.) The only difference between the vigilance of pure and that of interested love, is that the former is simple and peaceable, while the latter has not yet cast out fear. It is false teaching to say that we should hate ourselves; we should be in charity with ourselves as with others.[309]',\n",
       " 'We must fix our affections first on the humanity of Christ. Since our eyes cannot bear the unclouded light of the Godhead, \"we must live under the shadow of His manhood as long as we are here below.\" St. Paul tells his converts that he first preached to them of the humanity and passion of Christ, but afterwards of the Godhead, how that Christ is the power and wisdom of God[280].',\n",
       " 'We must next consider briefly the charge of Pantheism, which has been flung rather indiscriminately at nearly all speculative mystics, from Plotinus to Emerson. Dionysius, naturally enough, has been freely charged with it. The word is so loosely and thoughtlessly used, even by writers of repute, that I hope I may be pardoned if I try to distinguish (so far as can be done in a few words) between the various systems which have been called pantheistic.',\n",
       " 'We now come to St. Augustine himself, who at one period of his life was a diligent student of Plotinus. It would be hardly justifiable to claim St. Augustine as a mystic, since there are important parts of his teaching which have no affinity to Mysticism; but it touched him on one side, and he remained half a Platonist. His natural sympathy with Mysticism was not destroyed by the vulgar and perverted forms of it with which he was first brought in contact. The Manicheans and Gnostics only taught him to distinguish true Mysticism from false: he soon saw through the pretensions of these sectaries, while he was not ashamed to learn from Plotinus. The mystical or Neoplatonic element in his theology will be clearly shown in the following extracts. In a few places he comes dangerously near to some of the errors which we found in Dionysius.',\n",
       " \"We shall not meet, in this chapter, any finer examples of the Christian mystic than John Smith and William Law. But these men, and their intellectual kinsmen, were far from exhausting the treasure of Nature-Mysticism. The Cambridge Platonists, indeed, somewhat undervalued the religious lessons of Nature. They were scholars and divines, and what lay nearest their heart was the consecration of the reason--that is, of the whole personality under the guidance of its highest faculty--to the service of truth and goodness. And Law, in his later years, was too much under the influence of Böhme's fantastic theosophy to bring to Nature that childlike spirit which can best learn her lessons.\",\n",
       " 'What is the source of this strange aspiration to rise above Reason and Intelligence, which is for Plotinus the highest category of Being, and to come out \"on the other side of Being\" [Greek: epekeina tês ousias]? Plotinus says himself elsewhere that \"he who would rise above Reason, falls outside it\"; and yet he regards it as the highest reward of the philosopher-saint to converse with the hypostatised Abstraction who transcends all distinctions. The vision of the One is no part of his philosophy, but is a mischievous accretion. For though the \"superessential Absolute\" may be a logical necessity, we cannot make it, even in the most transcendental manner, an object of sense, without depriving it of its Absoluteness. What is really apprehended is not the Absolute, but a kind of \"form of formlessness,\" an idea not of the Infinite, but of the Indefinite.[147] It is then impossible to distinguish \"the One,\" who is said to be above all distinctions, from undifferentiated matter, the formless No-thing, which Plotinus puts at the lowest end of the scale.',\n",
       " 'When a religious writer is suspected of pantheism, we naturally turn to his treatment of the problem of evil. To the true pantheist all is equally divine, and everything for the best or for the worst, it does not much matter which.[244] Eckhart certainly does not mean to countenance this absurd theory, but there are passages in his writings which logically imply it; and we look in vain for any elucidation, in his doctrine of sin, of the dark places in his doctrine of God.[245] In fact, he adds very little to the Neoplatonic doctrine of the nature of evil. Like Dionysius, he identifies Being with Good, and evil, as such, with not-being. Moral evil is self-will: it is the attempt, on the part of the creature, to be a particular This or That outside of God.',\n",
       " 'When at last he was warned by an angel, he says, to discontinue his austerities, \"he spent several weeks very pleasantly,\" often weeping for joy at the thought of the grievous sufferings which he had undergone. But his repose was soon disturbed. One day, as he sat meditating on \"life as a warfare,\" he saw a vision of a comely youth, who vested him in the attire of a knight,[262] saying to him, \"Hearken, sir knight! Hitherto thou hast been a squire; now God wills thee to be a knight. And thou shalt have fighting enough!\" Suso cried, \"Alas, my God! what art Thou about to do unto me? I thought that I had had enough by this time. Show me how much suffering I have before me.\" The Lord said, \"It is better for thee not to know. Nevertheless I will tell thee of three things. Hitherto thou hast stricken thyself. Now I will strike thee, and thou shalt suffer publicly the loss of thy good name. Secondly, where thou shalt look for love and faithfulness, there shalt thou find treachery and suffering. Thirdly, hitherto thou hast floated in Divine sweetness, like a fish in the sea; this will I now withdraw from thee, and thou shalt starve and wither. Thou shalt be forsaken both by God and the world, and whatever thou shalt take in hand to comfort thee shall come to nought.\" The servitor threw himself on the ground, with arms outstretched to form a cross, and prayed in agony that this great misery might not fall upon him. Then a voice said to him, \"Be of good cheer, I will be with thee and aid thee to overcome.\"',\n",
       " 'When we try to represent to our minds the highest reality, the spiritual world, as distinguished from the world of appearance, we are obliged to form images; and we can hardly avoid choosing one of the following three images. We may regard the spiritual world as endless duration opposed to transitoriness, as infinite extension opposed to limitation in space, or as substance opposed to shadow. All these are, strictly speaking, symbols or metaphors,[37] for we cannot regard any of them as literally true statements about the nature of reality; but they are as near the truth as we can get in words. But when we think of time as a piece cut off from the beginning of eternity, so that eternity is only in the future and not in the present; when we think of heaven as a place somewhere else, and therefore not here; when we think of an upper ideal world which has sucked all the life out of this, so that we now walk in a vain shadow,--then we are paying the penalty for our symbolical representative methods of thought, and must go to philosophy to help us out of the doubts and difficulties in which our error has involved us. One test is infallible. Whatever view of reality deepens our sense of the tremendous issues of life in the world wherein we move, is for us nearer the truth than any view which diminishes that sense. The truth is revealed to us that we may have life, and have it more abundantly.',\n",
       " 'While Origen was working out his great system of ecclesiastical dogmatic, his younger contemporary Plotinus, outside the Christian pale, was laying the coping-stone on the edifice of Greek philosophy by a scheme of idealism which must always remain one of the greatest achievements of the human mind.[125] In the history of Mysticism he holds a more undisputed place than Plato; for some of the most characteristic doctrines of Mysticism, which in Plato are only thrown out tentatively, are in Plotinus welded into a compact whole. Among the doctrines which first receive a clear exposition in his writings are, his theory of the Absolute, whom he calls the One, or the Good; and his theory of the Ideas, which differs from Plato\\'s; for Plato represents the mind of the World-Artist as immanent in the Idea of the Good, while Plotinus makes the Ideas immanent in the universal mind; in other words, the real world (which he calls the \"intelligible world,\" the sphere of the Ideas) is in the mind of God. He also, in his doctrine of Vision, attaches an importance to revelation which was new in Greek philosophy. But his psychology is really the centre of his system, and it is here that the Christian Church and Christian Mysticism, in particular, is most indebted to him.',\n",
       " 'With Eckhart I end this Lecture on the speculative Mysticism of the Middle Ages. His successors, Ruysbroek, Suso, and Tauler, much as they resemble him in their general teaching, differ from him in this, that with none of them is the intellectual, philosophical side of primary importance. They added nothing of value to the speculative system of Eckhart; their Mysticism was primarily a religion of the heart or a rule of life. It is this side of Mysticism to which I shall next invite your attention. It should bring us near to the centre of our subject: for a speculative religious system is best known by its fruits.',\n",
       " 'Wordsworth is careful to inculcate several safeguards for those who would proceed to the contemplative life. First, there must be strenuous aspiration to reach that infinitude which is our being\\'s heart and home; we must press forward, urged by \"hope that can never die, effort, and expectation, and desire, and something evermore about to be.[377]\" The mind which is set upon the unchanging will not \"praise a cloud,[378]\" but will \"crave objects that endure.\" In the spirit of true Platonism, as contrasted with its later aberrations, Wordsworth will have no blurred outlines. He tries always to see in Nature distinction without separation; his principle is the exact antithesis of Hume\\'s atheistic dictum, that \"things are conjoined, but not connected.[379]\" The importance of this caution has been fully demonstrated in the course of our inquiry. Then, too, he knows that to imperfect man reason is a crown \"still to be courted, never to be won.\" Delusions may affect \"even the very faculty of sight,\" whether a man \"look forth,\" or \"dive into himself.[380]\" Again, he bids us seek for real, and not fanciful analogies; no \"loose types of things through all degrees\"; no mythology; and no arbitrary symbolism. The symbolic value of natural objects is not that they remind us of something that they are not, but that they help us to understand something that they in part are. They are not intended to transport us away from this earth into the clouds. \"This earth is the world of all of us,\" he says boldly, \"in which we find our happiness or not at all.[381]\" Lastly, and this is perhaps the most important of all, he recognises that the still small voice of God breathes not out of nature alone, nor out of the soul alone, but from the contact of the soul with nature. It is the marriage of the intellect of man to \"this goodly universe, in love and holy passion,\" which produces these raptures. \"Intellect\" includes Imagination, which is but another name for Reason in her most exalted mood;[382] these must assist the eye of sense.',\n",
       " 'Wordsworth was an eminently sane and manly spirit. He found his philosophy of life early, and not only preached but lived it consistently. A Platonist by nature rather than by study, he is thoroughly Greek in his distrust of strong emotions and in his love of all which the Greeks included under [Greek: sôphrosynê]. He was a loyal Churchman, but his religion was really almost independent of any ecclesiastical system. His ecclesiastical sonnets reflect rather the dignity of the Anglican Church than the ardent piety with which our other poet-mystics, such as Herbert, Vaughan, and Crashaw, adorn the offices of worship. His cast of faith, intellectual and contemplative rather than fervid, and the solitariness of his thought, forbade him to find much satisfaction in public ceremonial. He would probably agree with Galen, who in a very remarkable passage says that the study of nature, if prosecuted with the same earnestness and intensity which men bring to the contemplation of the \"Mysteries,\" is even more fitted than they to reveal the power and wisdom of God; for \"the symbolism of the mysteries is more obscure than that of nature.\"',\n",

       "['There is another expression which must be considered in connexion with the mediæval doctrine of deification. This is the intellectus agens, or [Greek: nous poiêtikos], which began its long history in Aristotle (De Anima, iii. 5). Aristotle there distinguishes two forms of Reason, which are related to each other as form and matter.Reason becomes all things, for the matter of anything is potentially the whole class to which it belongs; but Reason also makes all things, that is to say, it communicates to things those categories by which they become objects of thought.',\n",
       " 'This higher Reason is separate and impassible ([Greek: chôristos kai amigês kai apathês]); it is eternal and immortal; while the passive reason perishes with the body. The creative Reason is immanent both in the human mind and in the external world; and thus only is it possible for the mind to know things. Unfortunately, Aristotle says very little more about his [Greek: nous poiêtikos], and does not explain how the two Reasons are related to each other, thereby leaving the problem for his successors to work out.The most fruitful attempt to form a consistent theory, on an idealistic basis, out of the ambiguous and perhaps irreconcilable statements in the De Anima, was made by Alexander of Aphrodisias (about 200 A.D.), who taught that the Active Reason \"is not a part or faculty of our soul, but comes to us from without\"--it is, in fact, identified with the Spirit of God working in us.',\n",
       " 'Whether Aristotle would have accepted this interpretation of his theory may be doubted; but the commentary of Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Arabic, and this view of the Active Reason became the basis of the philosophy of Averroes. Averroes teaches that it is possible for the passive reason to unite itself with the Active Reason, and that this union may be attained or prepared for by ascetic purification and study. But he denies that the passive reason is perishable, not wishing entirely to depersonalise man.Herein he follows, he says, Themistius, whose views he tries to combine with those of Alexander.',\n",
       " 'Avicenna introduces a celestial hierarchy, in which the higher intelligences shed their light upon the lower, till they reach the Active Reason, which lies nearest to man, \"a quo, ut ipse dicit, effluunt species intelligibiles in animas nostras\" (Aquinas). The doctrine of \"monopsychism\" was, of course, condemned by the Church. Aquinas makes both the Active and Passive Reason parts of the human soul.Eckhart, as I have said in the fourth Lecture, at one period of his teaching expressly identifies the \"intellectus agens\" with the \"spark,\" in reference to which he says that \"here God\\'s ground is my ground, and my ground God\\'s ground.',\n",
       " 'This doctrine of the Divinity of the ground of the soul is very like the Cabbalistic doctrine of the Neschamah, and the Neoplatonic doctrine of [Greek: Nous] (cf. Stöckl, vol. ii. p. 1007). Eckhart was condemned for saying, \"aliquid est in anima quod est increatum et increabile; si tota anima esset talis, esset increata et increabilis. Hoc est intellectus.\" Eckhart certainly says explicitly that \"as fire turns all that it touches into itself, so the birth of the Son of God in the soul turns us into God, so that God no longer knows anything in us but His Son.',\n",
       " 'Man thus becomes \"filius naturalis Dei,\" instead of only \"filius adoptivus. \" We have seen that Eckhart, towards the end of his life, inclined more and more to separate the spark, the organ of Divine contemplation, from the reason. This is, of course, an approximation to the other view of deification--that of substitution or miraculous infusion from without, unless we see in it a tendency to divorce the personality from the reason.Ruysbroek states his doctrine of the Divine spark very clearly: \"The unity of our spirit in God exists in two ways, essentially and actively.',\n",
       " 'The essential existence of the soul, quæ secundum æternam ideam in Deo nos sumus, itemque quam in nobis habemus, medii ac discriminis expers est. Spiritus Deum in nuda natura essentialiter possidet, et spiritum Deus.Vivit namque in Deo et Deus in ipso; et secundum supremam sui partem Dei claritatem suscipere absque medio idoneus est; quin etiam per æterni exemplaris sui claritudinem essentialiter ac personaliter in ipso lucentis, secundum supremam vivacitatis suæ portionem, in divinam sese demittit ac demergit essentiam, ibidemque perseveranter secundum ideam manendo æternam suam possidet beatitudinem; rursusque cum creaturis omnibus per æternam Verbi generationem inde emanans, in esse suo creato constituitur.',\n",
       " 'The \"natural union,\" though it is the first cause of all holiness and blessedness, does not make us holy and blessed, being common to good and bad alike. \"Similitude\" to God is the work of grace, \"quæ lux quædam deiformis est. \" We cannot lose the \"unitas,\" but we can lose the \"similitudo quæ est gratia.\" The highest part of the soul is capable of receiving a perfect and immediate impression of the Divine essence; by this \"apex mentis\" we may \"sink into the Divine essence, and by a new (continuous) creation return to our created being according to the idea of God.',\n",
       " 'The question whether the \"ground of the soul\" is created or not is obviously a form of the question which we are now discussing. Giseler, as I have said, holds that it was created with the soul. Sterngassen says: \"That which God has in eternity in uncreated wise, that has the soul in time in created wise.\"But the author of the Treatise on Love, which belongs to this period, speaks of the spark as \"the Active Reason, which is God.\"And again, \"This is the Uncreated in the soul of which Master Eckhart speaks.\" Suso seems to imply that he believed the ground of the soul to be uncreated, an emanation of the Divine nature; and Tauler uses similar language.',\n",
       " 'Ruysbroek, in the last chapter of the Spiritual Nuptials, says that contemplative men \"see that they are the same simple ground as to their uncreated nature, and are one with the same light by which they see, and which they see. \" The later German mystics taught that the Divine essence is the material substratum of the world, the creative will of God having, so to speak, alienated for the purpose a portion of His own essence. If, then, the created form is broken through, God Himself becomes the ground of the soul.Even Augustine countenances some such notion when he says, \"From a good man, or from a good angel, take away \\'man\\' or \\'angel,\\' and you find God.\"',\n",
       " 'But one of the chief differences between the older and later Mysticism is that the former regarded union with God as achieved through the faculties of the soul, the latter as inherent in its essence. The doctrine of immanence, more and more emphasised, tended to encourage the belief that the Divine element in the soul is not merely something potential, something which the faculties may acquire, but is immanent and basal. Tauler mentions both views, and prefers the latter.Some hesitation may be traced in the Theologia Germanica on this point (p. 109, \"Golden Treasury\" edition): \"The true light is that eternal Light which is God; or else it is a created light, but yet Divine, which is called grace.',\n",
       " '\" Our Cambridge Platonists naturally revived this Platonic doctrine of deification, much to the dissatisfaction of some of their contemporaries. Tuckney speaks of their teaching as \"a kind of moral divinity minted only with a little tincture of Christ added. Nay, a Platonic faith unites to God!\"Notwithstanding such protests, the Platonists persisted that all true happiness consists in a participation of God; and that \"we cannot enjoy God by any external conjunction with Him.\"']"
